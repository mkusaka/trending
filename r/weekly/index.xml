    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Equipment Loss Tracking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Russia-Ukraine War&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using data from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html&#34;&gt;Oryx&#39;s site&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;ve put together a quick tracker to visualize equipment losses since &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War&#34;&gt;Russia&#39;s February 24th invasion of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. This is only equipment that is independently verified, as noted by Oryx:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;This list only includes destroyed vehicles and equipment of which photo or videographic evidence is available. Therefore, the amount of equipment destroyed is significantly higher than recorded here. Small arms, munitions, civilian vehicles, trailers and derelict equipment (including aircraft) are not included in this list. All possible effort has gone into discerning the status of equipment between captured or abandoned. Many of the entries listed as &#39;abandoned&#39; will likely end up captured or destroyed. Similarly, some of the captured equipment might be destroyed if it can&#39;t be recovered. ATGMs and MANPADS are included in the list but not included in the ultimate count. The Soviet flag is used when the equipment in question was produced prior to 1991.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Data is drawn from &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bngHbR0YPS7XH1oSA1VxoL4R34z60SJcR3NxguZM9GI/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;this public google sheet&lt;/a&gt; which is updated based on the last update for each day. As such it is a lagging indicator, dependent not just on when equipment is lost, but when it is discovered and documented.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Data is pulled daily from Oryx&#39;s site using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/scarnecchia&#34;&gt;Daniel Scarnecchia&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/scarnecchia/scrape_oryx&#34;&gt;scraper tool&lt;/a&gt;, and then pushed to the public google sheet, where synthetic calculations are performed for equipment categories (to presere transparency).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Points (red = Russia, blue = Ukraine) represent cumulative losses for each day, bars represent daily losses. The line repreents a general additive model smooth on cumulative losses to date; the shaded grey band represents the 95% confidence interval based on extant variation (e.g. point scatter). A wider grey band means more uncertainty, a narrower grey band means less uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind that this is empirical, not inteptetive, analysis. A concern raised about the available data is that it undercounts Ukrainian losses. This is possible not just because of bias (note pro-Russian sources are monitered as well) but because areas under Russian control are less likely to have photo documentation. Fog of war is very real. There is no attempt here to use a modifier to adjust numbers - analysis is strictly empirical. Any bias in the origional data will be reflected in the following analyses.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Total Equipment Losses&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_total.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Ukranian and Russian equipment losses started off equivalent, but Russians quickly began to lose more equipment by the third day of the war.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Maps&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Map data is provided using a google maps base layer with troop locations from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/HN_Schlottman&#34;&gt;Henry Schlottman&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/simonhuwiler/uawardata&#34;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;. Fire data comes from &lt;a href=&#34;https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov&#34;&gt;NASA FIRMS&lt;/a&gt; VIIRS sattelite.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Battle of Kyiv&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Maps/battleofkyiv.gif?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; The [Battle of Kyiv](&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kyiv_(2022)&#34;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kyiv_(2022)&lt;/a&gt; concluded at the beginning of April 2022 in a Ukrainan victory. NASA FIRMS analysis indicates that the majority of detectible fire from fighting was in the last two weeks of the conflict (March 15th - April 1st).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Donbas and Kharkiv&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Maps/donbas_map.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Russia has concentrated most of its combat forces in the Donbas attempting to breakthrough Ukranian lines established in 2014. FIRMS fire data indicates battles around Izyum, with some progress for Russia to the west.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Maps/battleofdonbas.gif?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; The [Battle of the Donbas](&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Donbas_(2022)&#34;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Donbas_(2022)&lt;/a&gt; has only shown a distinct FIRMS signature since the first week of May, indicating heavy fires all around.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Kherson&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Maps/kherson_map.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Kherson is an occupied city where the Russian advance was halted. FIRMS data does not indicate heavy combat in the area currently.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;FIRMS Summary&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/firms_summary_plot.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Summing megawatts of energy radiated from regions of Ukraine helps highlight the independent war record. The Battle of Kyiv is clearly visible, with detectable fires concentrated in the last two weeks (March 15th - April 1st). The Battle of Donbas, following a repositioning of Russian forces, shows a more brief but just as intense spike in radiation confined to the first two weeks of May.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Destroyed Equipment&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_destroyed.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Destroyed Russian equipment outpaced destroyed Ukranian equipment by the second day of the war, though there are signs it is starting to taper.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Abandoned Equipment&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_abandoned.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Ukranians abandoned equipment more readily in the early days fo the war, but by the third day this rate plateaued. Russian abandonments increased sharply on the third day, and began to taper at the end of the first week.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Captured Equipment&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_captured.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Russians have seen a much higher rate of equipment capture since the start of the war, with a sharp increase in the second week, though this has begun to taper by the start of the third week.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The degree to which Russians have lost more equipment (in every category type) is very striking. It is certaintly possible this is a product of Ukranians focusing on documenting Russian losses, though this can&#39;t be a complete explanation.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Equipment Net Changes&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_absolute_total.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; This calculation subtracts units captured by each combatant with their other loss types (destroyed, damaged, and abandoned). It is arguable if a proportion of abandonded should be included as captures. Ukraine has a net positive change in equipment - meaning they&#39;ve captured more than they&#39;ve lost. Russia however has lost many more units than it has aquired from Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Ratios&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/ratio_grid.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; This plot shows the ratios of losses (e.g. proportion of total) for Russia and Ukraine for each loss type.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Refugees&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;These data are gathered by the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR) operational data portal (ODP) &lt;a href=&#34;https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The line represents total refugees, while the bars below indicate daily totals.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/refugees_total.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refugee outflows peaked on the 7th of March, but migration continues to be heavy. Refugees are primarily destined for Poland initially, though other nearby countries such as Moldova and Hungary are taking large numbers as well. This only counts migration out of Ukraine - internal displacement of &lt;a href=&#34;https://displacement.iom.int/reports/ukraine-internal-displacement-report-general-population-survey-round-2-24-march-1-april&#34;&gt;7.1 million people&lt;/a&gt; has occured since the conflict began. All together over 25% of Ukraine&#39;s population, or more than 1 out of every 4 Ukrainians, has had to move since the war began.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Raw Equipment Losses&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#34;Raw&#34; refers to a specific type of vehicle, such as a tank or armored personell carrier&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Tanks&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_tanks.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Tank losses were equivalent in the first four days of the war, with Russian tank loses increasing sharpely thereafter, though a jump in Ukranian tank losses can be seen at the start of the second week of the war.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_percent_total_tanks.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; This graph, however, highlights the challenges Ukraine still faces. When the sheer scale of &lt;a href=&#34;https://inews.co.uk/news/world/russia-tanks-how-many-putin-armoured-forces-ukraine-nato-explained-1504470&#34;&gt;Russian tanks&lt;/a&gt; are considered (13,300 vs. 2,100 for Ukraine), the steep Russian losses are not yet bringing parity. In general, Ukraine loses 1 tank for every 3 it takes from Russia. This ratio has to get to 4 or higher to be sustainble. Note that this estimate factors in verified tank captures by both Russia and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_percent_deployed_tanks.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; If we consider estimates of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.as.com/en/2022/02/24/latest_news/1645729870_894320.html&#34;&gt;deployed Russian tanks&lt;/a&gt; instead of their total (2,840 vs. 2,100 for Ukraine), the picture is not as dire for Ukraine. This estimate likely is closer to the battlefont picture, as not all Russian tanks could be deployed at once, though Russia can sustain attrition longer than Ukraine. Note that this estimate factors in verified tank captures by both Russia and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_percent_total_tanks_baseline.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; If we consider estimates of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.as.com/en/2022/02/24/latest_news/1645729870_894320.html&#34;&gt;deployed Russian tanks&lt;/a&gt; fixed to their total inventory, it is clear that Ukraine is adding to its tank fleet near the rate Russia is losing theirs. Though note that this measure assumes Russia has the capability to use all 13,300 of its tanks in Ukraine if needed.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_percent_deployed_tanks_baseline.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; If we consider estimates of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.as.com/en/2022/02/24/latest_news/1645729870_894320.html&#34;&gt;deployed Russian tanks&lt;/a&gt; fixed to their starting number, the picture is considerably more positive for Ukraine. Instead of recording only losses, this fixes the baseline (2,840 for Russia vs. 2,100 for Ukraine) and factors both tank losses and gains (e.g. captures). By this metric Russia has lost well over 5% of its tanks while Ukraine has supplemented its by 2% (e.g. captured more than it has lost).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Armored Fighting Vehicles (AFV)&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_afv.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Armored Fighting Vehicles also see parity in losses in the first 4 days of the war, though Russian losses increase less dramatically than is seen with tanks. Note that this estimate factors in verified AFV captures by both Russia and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_percent_afv.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; When normalized to standing inventory, Russia&#39;s losses are a less significant fraction of their total inventory compared to Ukraine. This higlhights the steep challenge Ukraine faces. In general, Ukraine loses 1 AFV for every 3 it takes from Russia. This ratio has to get to 4 or higher to be sustainble.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_percent_total_afv_baseline.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; If we consider estimates of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.as.com/en/2022/02/24/latest_news/1645729870_894320.html&#34;&gt;deployed Russian AFV&lt;/a&gt; fixed to their total inventory, Ukraine is adding modestly to its AFV inventory at the same rate which Russia is losing its AFV.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Artillery&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_artillery.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; The ratio of Russian to Ukrainian artillery losses is 3:1, though Russia&#39;s losses have plateued since the first week of April.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV)&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_ifv.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Ukranian&#39;s lost more Infrantry Fighting Vehicles in the first two days of the war, with Russian losses acellerating linearly until the end of the second week.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Armored Personel Carriers (APC)&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_apc.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Ukranian&#39;s lost more Armored Personel Carriers in the first two days of the war, with Russian losses acellerating linearly until the end of the second week, though the differential is less dramatic than with AFVs.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Infantry Mobility Vehicles (IMV)&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_imv.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Infantry Mobility Vehicle losses are more or less equivalent between Ukranian and Russian forces through the first two weeks of the war.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Synthetic Equipment Losses&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#34;Synthetic&#34; refers to a combination of vehicle types to form a theme - such as aircraft (fighters + helicopters + drones) or anti-aircraft (SAM + MANPADS), etc.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Aircraft&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_aircraft.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Ukranians have lost aircraft linearly, while Russians lost them almost exponentially in teh first two weeks of the war, though there are signs this is tapering sharpely. This calculation includes fighters, helicotpers, and drones.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Anti-air&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_antiair.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Ukranians sustained higher rates of loss of anti-air systems through the first week of the war, though Russian losses have since outpaced them by the second week of the war. This calculation includes MANPADS, SAMs, self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, radar, and jamming systems.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Armor&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_armor.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Russian and Ukranian armor losses were equivalent in the first three days of the war, with Russian losses significantly outpacing Ukranians since. This calculaton includes both tanks and armored fighting vehicles.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_percent_total_armor_baseline.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; If we consider estimates of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.as.com/en/2022/02/24/latest_news/1645729870_894320.html&#34;&gt;deployed Russian armor&lt;/a&gt; fixed to their total inventory, Ukraine is adding modestly to its armor inventory at the same rate which Russia is losing its Armor.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Infantry&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_infantry.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Infantry losses were higher among Ukranians at the start of the war, with Russian losses increasing sharply since then. Ukranian losses taper in the second week. This calculation includes infantry fighting vehicles, armored personell carriers, and infantry mobility vehicles.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Vehicles (standard transportation)&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_vehicles.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Ukranians lost more vehicles on the first day, with Russian losses accelerating since then. This calculation includes all non-specialized vehicle types.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Logistics Systems&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_logistics.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Ukranians have lost few logistics systems, while Russian losses increased linearly until the end of the second when they began to taper. This calculation includes engineering and communications vehicles.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;#Analysis By grouping synthetic vehicles, we can see how different systems have been prioritized by Russian or Ukranians, providing a glimpse into strategy.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Loss Type&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_loss_type.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; These ratio plots use Russian equipment losses as the numerator and Ukranian losses as the denominator. The higher the bar, the higher the proportion of Russian losses. While Russians have abandoned vehicles at a higher rate, destructions remain the highest differential between the two armies.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Unit Type&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_unit_type.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Here, Ukranian strategy is abundantly clear. It has targeted Russian logistics operations (higher bar = more Russian losses) to an overwhelming degree. Russians have focused on anti-air systems (lower bar = more Ukranian losses), though remarkably despite this focus Ukranian&#39;s still have an almost 2-1 edge on taking these systems out.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not a military expert, but by the second week of the war it is clear that the Russian objective of suppressing Ukranian aircraft and anti-air failed, leading to contested airspace. In contrast, Ukranian&#39;s succeeded in interfering with Russian logistics, evidenced by their focus on logistics vehicles and fuel lines. This has ground the Russian advance to a halt by the third day, with limited change since then.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

Admittedly, it&#39;s sort of a hack until we come up with a more robust solution for in-class use (i.e. an instructor &#34;dashboard&#34;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Intermediate&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regression Models&lt;/strong&gt;: The basics of regression modeling in R&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting and Cleaning Data&lt;/strong&gt;: dplyr, tidyr, lubridate, oh my!&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Advanced&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statistical Inference&lt;/strong&gt;: This intermediate to advanced level course closely follows the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/course/statinference&#34;&gt;Statistical Inference course&lt;/a&gt; of the Johns Hopkins &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1&#34;&gt;Data Science Specialization&lt;/a&gt; on Coursera. It introduces the student to basic concepts of statistical inference including probability, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals and p-values. It concludes with an initiation to topics of particular relevance to big data, issues of multiple testing and resampling.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://swirlstats.com/scn/arp.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced R Programming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since our users come from a variety backgrounds, it&#39;s very hard to label material as &lt;strong&gt;Beginner&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Intermediate&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;Advanced&lt;/strong&gt;. If you find something that is labelled &lt;strong&gt;Beginner&lt;/strong&gt; to be challenging, please don&#39;t be discouraged. The first step of learning anything is to acknowledge that you are capable of understanding it. True understanding will come with time and practice.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Course Authors&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing swirl Courses&lt;/strong&gt;: An interactive guides and example for swirl course authors. The first group of lessons cover basics. The rest cover special topics useful primarily as samples--points of departure for one&#39;s own material. For more comprehensive documentation about writing your own swirl courses see &lt;a href=&#34;http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/&#34;&gt;http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Install and run a course automatically from swirl&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the preferred method of installing courses.&lt;/strong&gt; It automates the process by allowing you to do everything right from the R console.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Make sure you have a recent version version of swirl:&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;install.packages(&#34;swirl&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Enter the following from the R console, &lt;strong&gt;substituting the name of the course&lt;/strong&gt; that you wish to install:&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(swirl)&#xA;install_course(&#34;Course Name Here&#34;)&#xA;swirl()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;code&gt;install_course(&#34;R Programming&#34;)&lt;/code&gt; will install the R Programming course. &lt;strong&gt;Please note that course names are case sensitive!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If that doesn&#39;t work for you...&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Install and run a course manually&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the automatic course installation method outlined above does not work for you, then there&#39;s a simple alternative.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Find the course you want to install on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://swirlstats.com/scn/title.html&#34;&gt;Swirl Course network website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Follow the manual installation instructions on the course page.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If that does not work for you, consider taking a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses/wiki/Legacy-Manual-Install-Instructions-for-Swirl-Courses&#34;&gt;legacy manual install instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Uninstall a course&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;d like to remove a course at any time, you can use &lt;code&gt;uninstall_course(&#34;Course Name Here&#34;)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Using swirl in the classroom&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instructors around the world are using swirl in their classrooms. We think this is awesome. If you&#39;re an instructor, please feel free to do the same -- free of charge. While your students may be paying to take your course or attend your institution, we simply ask that you don&#39;t charge people &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; for the use of our software or instructional content.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are not sure about a particular use case, don&#39;t hesitate to post a question to our &lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/swirl-discuss&#34;&gt;Google Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;# The easiest way to get ggplot2 is to install the whole tidyverse:&#xA;install.packages(&#34;tidyverse&#34;)&#xA;&#xA;# Alternatively, install just ggplot2:&#xA;install.packages(&#34;ggplot2&#34;)&#xA;&#xA;# Or the development version from GitHub:&#xA;# install.packages(&#34;devtools&#34;)&#xA;devtools::install_github(&#34;tidyverse/ggplot2&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Cheatsheet&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/pngs/thumbnails/data-visualization-cheatsheet-thumbs.png&#34; width=&#34;630&#34; height=&#34;252&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to succinctly describe how ggplot2 works because it embodies a deep philosophy of visualisation. However, in most cases you start with &lt;code&gt;ggplot()&lt;/code&gt;, supply a dataset and aesthetic mapping (with &lt;code&gt;aes()&lt;/code&gt;). You then add on layers (like &lt;code&gt;geom_point()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;geom_histogram()&lt;/code&gt;), scales (like &lt;code&gt;scale_colour_brewer()&lt;/code&gt;), faceting specifications (like &lt;code&gt;facet_wrap()&lt;/code&gt;) and coordinate systems (like &lt;code&gt;coord_flip()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;library(ggplot2)&#xA;&#xA;ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + &#xA;  geom_point()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/main/man/figures/README-example-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA; &lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Lifecycle&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-stable-brightgreen.svg?sanitize=true&#34; alt=&#34;lifecycle&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;ggplot2 is now over 10 years old and is used by hundreds of thousands of people to make millions of plots. That means, by-and-large, ggplot2 itself changes relatively little. When we do make changes, they will be generally to add new functions or arguments rather than changing the behaviour of existing functions, and if we do make changes to existing behaviour we will do them for compelling reasons.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for innovation, look to ggplot2’s rich ecosystem of extensions. See a community maintained list at &lt;a href=&#34;https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/&#34;&gt;https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Learning ggplot2&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are new to ggplot2 you are better off starting with a systematic introduction, rather than trying to learn from reading individual documentation pages. Currently, there are three good places to start:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html&#34;&gt;Data Visualisation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html&#34;&gt;Graphics for communication&lt;/a&gt; chapters in &lt;a href=&#34;https://r4ds.had.co.nz&#34;&gt;R for Data Science&lt;/a&gt;. R for Data Science is designed to give you a comprehensive introduction to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tidyverse.org&#34;&gt;tidyverse&lt;/a&gt;, and these two chapters will get you up to speed with the essentials of ggplot2 as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’d like to take an online course, try &lt;a href=&#34;https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/data-visualization-in/9781491963661/&#34;&gt;Data Visualization in R With ggplot2&lt;/a&gt; by Kara Woo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’d like to follow a webinar, try &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/h29g21z0a68&#34;&gt;Plotting Anything with ggplot2&lt;/a&gt; by Thomas Lin Pedersen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to dive into making common graphics as quickly as possible, I recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://r-graphics.org&#34;&gt;The R Graphics Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; by Winston Chang. It provides a set of recipes to solve common graphics problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve mastered the basics and want to learn more, read &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggplot2-book.org&#34;&gt;ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis&lt;/a&gt;. It describes the theoretical underpinnings of ggplot2 and shows you how all the pieces fit together. This book helps you understand the theory that underpins ggplot2, and will help you create new types of graphics specifically tailored to your needs.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Getting help&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two main places to get help with ggplot2:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.rstudio.com/&#34;&gt;RStudio community&lt;/a&gt; is a friendly place to ask any questions about ggplot2.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ggplot2?sort=frequent&amp;amp;pageSize=50&#34;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; is a great source of answers to common ggplot2 questions. It is also a great place to get help, once you have created a reproducible example that illustrates your problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary>

You can learn more about them in &lt;code&gt;vignette(&#34;dplyr&#34;)&lt;/code&gt;. As well as these single-table verbs, dplyr also provides a variety of two-table verbs, which you can learn about in &lt;code&gt;vignette(&#34;two-table&#34;)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are new to dplyr, the best place to start is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html&#34;&gt;data transformation chapter&lt;/a&gt; in R for data science.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Backends&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to data frames/tibbles, dplyr makes working with other computational backends accessible and efficient. Below is a list of alternative backends:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dtplyr.tidyverse.org/&#34;&gt;dtplyr&lt;/a&gt;: for large, in-memory datasets. Translates your dplyr code to high performance &lt;a href=&#34;https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/&#34;&gt;data.table&lt;/a&gt; code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/&#34;&gt;dbplyr&lt;/a&gt;: for data stored in a relational database. Translates your dplyr code to SQL.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://spark.rstudio.com&#34;&gt;sparklyr&lt;/a&gt;: for very large datasets stored in &lt;a href=&#34;https://spark.apache.org&#34;&gt;Apache Spark&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

Harmony has been tested on Linux, OS X, and Windows platforms.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Installation&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To run Harmony, open R and install harmony from CRAN:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;install.packages(&#34;harmony&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;d like the latest development version, install from this github directly:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;library(devtools)&#xA;install_github(&#34;immunogenomics/harmony&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Usage/Demos&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We made it easy to run Harmony in most common R analysis pipelines.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Quick Start&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Check out this &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony/raw/master/vignettes/quickstart.Rmd&#34;&gt;vignette&lt;/a&gt; for a quick start tutorial.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;PCA matrix&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Harmony algorithm iteratively corrects PCA embeddings. To input your own low dimensional embeddings directly, set &lt;code&gt;do_pca=FALSE&lt;/code&gt;. Harmony is packaged with a small dataset&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;library(harmony)&#xA;my_harmony_embeddings &amp;lt;- HarmonyMatrix(my_pca_embeddings, meta_data, &#34;dataset&#34;, do_pca=FALSE)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Normalized gene matrix&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also run Harmony on a sparse matrix of library size normalized expression counts. Harmony will scale these counts, run PCA, and finally perform integration.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;library(harmony)&#xA;my_harmony_embeddings &amp;lt;- HarmonyMatrix(normalized_counts, meta_data, &#34;dataset&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Seurat&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can run Harmony within your Seurat workflow. You&#39;ll only need to make two changes to your code.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Run Harmony with the &lt;code&gt;RunHarmony()&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;In downstream analyses, use the Harmony embeddings instead of PCA.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, run Harmony and then UMAP in two lines.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;seuratObj &amp;lt;- RunHarmony(seuratObj, &#34;dataset&#34;)&#xA;seuratObj &amp;lt;- RunUMAP(seuratObj, reduction = &#34;harmony&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For details, check out these vignettes:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony/raw/master/docs/SeuratV2.html&#34;&gt;Seurat V2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony/raw/master/docs/SeuratV3.html&#34;&gt;Seurat V3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;MUDAN&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can run Harmony with functions from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jefworks/mudan&#34;&gt;MUDAN package&lt;/a&gt;. For more, details, check out this &lt;a href=&#34;http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony/raw/master/docs/mudan.html&#34;&gt;vignette&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Harmony with two or more covariates&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Harmony can integrate over multiple covariates. To do this, specify a vector covariates to integrate.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;my_harmony_embeddings &amp;lt;- HarmonyMatrix(&#xA;  my_pca_embeddings, meta_data, c(&#34;dataset&#34;, &#34;donor&#34;, &#34;batch_id&#34;),&#xA;  do_pca = FALSE&#xA;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do the same with your Seurat object:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;seuratObject &amp;lt;- RunHarmony(seuratObject, c(&#34;dataset&#34;, &#34;donor&#34;, &#34;batch_id&#34;))&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Advanced&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The examples above all return integrated PCA embeddings. We created a more &lt;a href=&#34;http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony/raw/master/docs/advanced.html&#34;&gt;advanced tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that explores the internal data structures used in the Harmony algorithm.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Reproducing results from manuscript&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Code to reproduce Harmony results from the Korsunsky et al 2019 manuscript will be made available on github.com/immunogenomics/harmony2019.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

It uses various machine learning techniques (Ridge regression, multi-objective evolutionary algorithm for hyperparameter optimization, time-series decomposition for trend &amp;amp; season, gradient-based optimization for budget allocation etc.) to define media channel efficiency and effectivity, explore adstock rates and saturation curves. It&#39;s built for granular datasets with many independent variables and therefore especially suitable for digital and direct response advertisers with rich data sources.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Why are we doing this&lt;/strong&gt;: MMM used to be a resource-intensive technique that was only affordable for &#34;big players&#34;. As the privacy needs of the measurement landscape evolve, there&#39;s a clear trend of increasing demand for modern MMM as a privacy-safe solution. At Meta Marketing Science, our mission is to help all businesses grow by transforming marketing practices grounded in data and science.

For the version history and detailed important changes, please see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat/raw/master/NEWS.md&#34;&gt;NEWS file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Capabilities&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to infer the intercellular communication from any given scRNA-seq data, CellChat provides functionality for further data exploration, analysis, and visualization.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;It is able to analyze cell-cell communication for continuous states along cellular development trajectories.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;It can quantitatively characterize and compare the inferred cell-cell communication networks using an integrated approach by combining social network analysis, pattern recognition, and manifold learning approaches.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;It provides an easy-to-use tool for extracting and visualizing high-order information of the inferred networks. For example, it allows ready prediction of major signaling inputs and outputs for all cell populations and how these populations and signals coordinate together for functions.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;It provides several visualization outputs to facilitate intuitive user-guided data interpretation.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21246-9&#34;&gt;our paper (Jin et al., Nature Communications, 2021)&lt;/a&gt; for the detailed methods and applications.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;CellChat R package can be easily installed from Github using devtools:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;devtools::install_github(&#34;sqjin/CellChat&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please make sure you have installed the correct version of &lt;code&gt;NMF&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;circlize&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/strong&gt;.

This relieves the developers from addressing the same issues and helps them focus on adding new features!&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;The best way to figure out the issues is &lt;strong&gt;running the sources codes&lt;/strong&gt; of the specific functions by yourself. This will also relieve the developers and helps them focus on the common issues! I am sorry, but I have to say I have no idea on many errors except that I can reproduce the issues.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Minimal and &lt;strong&gt;reproducible example&lt;/strong&gt; are required when filing a GitHub issue. In certain cases, please share your CellChat object and related codes to reproduce the issues.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Users are encouraged to discuss issues and bugs using the github &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat/issues&#34;&gt;issues&lt;/a&gt; instead of email exchanges.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Contribution&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;CellChat is an open source software package and any contribution is highly appreciated!&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We use GitHub&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat/pulls&#34;&gt;Pull Request&lt;/a&gt; mechanism for reviewing and accepting submissions of any contribution.

It includes functions that take advantage of new data classes to work seamlessly from importing raw spectra and images, to visualisation and analysis. It provides flexible ways to input spectral data from a variety of equipment manufacturers, process these data, extract variables, and produce publication-quality figures.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pavo&lt;/code&gt; was written with the following workflow in mind:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organise&lt;/strong&gt; data by importing and processing spectra and images (e.g., to remove noise, negative values, smooth curves, etc.).&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analyse&lt;/strong&gt; the resulting files, using spectral analyses of shape (hue, saturation, brightness), visual models based on perceptual data, and/or spatial adjacency and boundary strength analyses.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualise&lt;/strong&gt; the output, with multiple options provided for exploration, presentation, and analysis.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Need more information, or help with the package?&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Take a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://book.colrverse.com&#34;&gt;package documentation&lt;/a&gt; for detailed examples and discussion.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pavo.colrverse.com/news/index.html&#34;&gt;latest news&lt;/a&gt; for changes and updates.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need help or advice and can&#39;t find what you&#39;re looking for?&lt;/strong&gt; Head over to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/colrverse/colRverse/discussions&#34;&gt;colRverse discussion board&lt;/a&gt; and feel free to post a message.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If all else fails&lt;/strong&gt; (or you don&#39;t have a GitHub account), &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:thomas.white@sydney.edu.au&#34;&gt;email Tom&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Citing pavo&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manuscript describing the current iteration of the package has been published and is free to access:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maia R., Gruson H., Endler J.A., and White T.E. 2019 &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13174&#34;&gt;pavo 2: New tools for the spectral and spatial analysis of colour in R&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Methods in Ecology and Evolution&lt;/em&gt;, 10(7):1097‑1107.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Install&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the development page for &lt;code&gt;pavo&lt;/code&gt;.

It demonstrated a significantly increased risk of major ischemic or hemorrhagic events associated with treatment of rivaroxaban compared to that of apixaban. This study aims to independently replicate that study using a similar database. It also aims to evaluate the robustness of the study findings by conducting sensitivity analyses, assessing: 1) changes to definitions of exposure and outcome phenotypes, 2) calibration of effect estimates using empirical null distributions, and 3) observable study diagnostics that inform the validity of a given analysis. Finally, it aims to explore the generalizability of the findings by executing the analysis on alternative databases with varying populations (U.S. and non-U.S.) and mechanisms of data capture (electronic health records data).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Requirements&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;A database in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel&#34;&gt;Common Data Model version 5&lt;/a&gt; in one of these platforms: SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, IBM Netezza, Apache Impala, Amazon RedShift, Google BigQuery, or Microsoft APS.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;R version 4.0.0 or newer&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;On Windows: &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/&#34;&gt;RTools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://java.com&#34;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/&#34;&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;How to Run&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades/rSetup.html&#34;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt; for setting up your R environment, including RTools and Java.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Create an Rstudio project:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;In Rstudio, click on File &amp;gt; New Project&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;New window asks to select the type of project; select Version COntrol &amp;gt; Git&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Clone an existing repository: &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;In the textbox Repository URL place: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/ReproducibilityRayJAMA2021.git&#34;&gt;https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/ReproducibilityRayJAMA2021.git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;This will fill in a project directory name of: ReproducibilityRayJAMA2021&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;Identify directory where you want this project&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;The project will be cloned into the folder&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Set up &lt;code&gt;renv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;If not already installed, run &lt;code&gt;install.packages(&#34;renv&#34;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;renv::restore()&lt;/code&gt; in the R console.

If you are an R developer that uses Python for some of your work or a member of data science team that uses both languages, reticulate can dramatically streamline your workflow!&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Getting started&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Installation&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Install the &lt;strong&gt;reticulate&lt;/strong&gt; package from CRAN as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;install.packages(&#34;reticulate&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Python version&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;By default, reticulate uses the version of Python found on your &lt;code&gt;PATH&lt;/code&gt; (i.e. &lt;code&gt;Sys.which(&#34;python&#34;)&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;use_python()&lt;/code&gt; function enables you to specify an alternate version, for example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;library(reticulate)&#xA;use_python(&#34;/usr/local/bin/python&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;use_virtualenv()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;use_condaenv()&lt;/code&gt; functions enable you to specify versions of Python in virtual or Conda environments, for example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;library(reticulate)&#xA;use_virtualenv(&#34;myenv&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See the article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/versions.html&#34;&gt;Python Version Configuration&lt;/a&gt; for additional details.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Python packages&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can install any required Python packages using standard shell tools like &lt;code&gt;pip&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;conda&lt;/code&gt;. Alternately, reticulate includes a set of functions for managing and installing packages within virtualenvs and Conda environments. See the article on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/python_packages.html&#34;&gt;Installing Python Packages&lt;/a&gt; for additional details.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Calling Python&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are a variety of ways to integrate Python code into your R projects:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/reticulate/main/#python-in-r-markdown&#34;&gt;Python in R Markdown&lt;/a&gt; — A new Python language engine for R Markdown that supports bi-directional communication between R and Python (R chunks can access Python objects and vice-versa).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/reticulate/main/#importing-python-modules&#34;&gt;Importing Python modules&lt;/a&gt; — The &lt;code&gt;import()&lt;/code&gt; function enables you to import any Python module and call it’s functions directly from R.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/reticulate/main/#sourcing-python-scripts&#34;&gt;Sourcing Python scripts&lt;/a&gt; — The &lt;code&gt;source_python()&lt;/code&gt; function enables you to source a Python script the same way you would &lt;code&gt;source()&lt;/code&gt; an R script (Python functions and objects defined within the script become directly available to the R session).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/reticulate/main/#python-repl&#34;&gt;Python REPL&lt;/a&gt; — The &lt;code&gt;repl_python()&lt;/code&gt; function creates an interactive Python console within R. Objects you create within Python are available to your R session (and vice-versa).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each of these techniques is explained in more detail below.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Python in R Markdown&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;reticulate&lt;/strong&gt; package includes a Python engine for &lt;a href=&#34;https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/&#34;&gt;R Markdown&lt;/a&gt; with the following features:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Run Python chunks in a single Python session embedded within your R session (shared variables/state between Python chunks)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Printing of Python output, including graphical output from &lt;a href=&#34;https://matplotlib.org/&#34;&gt;matplotlib&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Access to objects created within Python chunks from R using the &lt;code&gt;py&lt;/code&gt; object (e.g. &lt;code&gt;py$x&lt;/code&gt; would access an &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; variable created within Python from R).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Access to objects created within R chunks from Python using the &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; object (e.g. &lt;code&gt;r.x&lt;/code&gt; would access to &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; variable created within R from Python)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Built in conversion for many Python object types is provided, including &lt;a href=&#34;https://numpy.org/&#34;&gt;NumPy&lt;/a&gt; arrays and &lt;a href=&#34;https://pandas.pydata.org/&#34;&gt;Pandas&lt;/a&gt; data frames. For example, you can use Pandas to read and manipulate data then easily plot the Pandas data frame using &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/&#34;&gt;ggplot2&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/reticulate/main/man/figures/rmarkdown_engine_zoomed.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that the reticulate Python engine is enabled by default within R Markdown whenever reticulate is installed.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/r_markdown.html&#34;&gt;R Markdown Python Engine&lt;/a&gt; documentation for additional details.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Importing Python modules&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can use the &lt;code&gt;import()&lt;/code&gt; function to import any Python module and call it from R. For example, this code imports the Python &lt;code&gt;os&lt;/code&gt; module and calls the &lt;code&gt;listdir()&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;library(reticulate)&#xA;os &amp;lt;- import(&#34;os&#34;)&#xA;os$listdir(&#34;.&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34;&gt; [1] &#34;.git&#34;             &#34;.gitignore&#34;       &#34;.Rbuildignore&#34;    &#34;.RData&#34;&#xA; [5] &#34;.Rhistory&#34;        &#34;.Rproj.user&#34;      &#34;.travis.yml&#34;      &#34;appveyor.yml&#34;&#xA; [9] &#34;DESCRIPTION&#34;      &#34;docs&#34;             &#34;external&#34;         &#34;index.html&#34;&#xA;[13] &#34;index.Rmd&#34;        &#34;inst&#34;             &#34;issues&#34;           &#34;LICENSE&#34;&#xA;[17] &#34;man&#34;              &#34;NAMESPACE&#34;        &#34;NEWS.md&#34;          &#34;pkgdown&#34;&#xA;[21] &#34;R&#34;                &#34;README.md&#34;        &#34;reticulate.Rproj&#34; &#34;src&#34;&#xA;[25] &#34;tests&#34;            &#34;vignettes&#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Functions and other data within Python modules and classes can be accessed via the &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; operator (analogous to the way you would interact with an R list, environment, or reference class).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Imported Python modules support code completion and inline help:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/reticulate/main/man/figures/reticulate_completion.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/calling_python.html&#34;&gt;Calling Python from R&lt;/a&gt; for additional details on interacting with Python objects from within R.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Sourcing Python scripts&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can source any Python script just as you would source an R script using the &lt;code&gt;source_python()&lt;/code&gt; function. For example, if you had the following Python script &lt;em&gt;flights.py&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-python&#34;&gt;import pandas&#xA;def read_flights(file):&#xA;  flights = pandas.read_csv(file)&#xA;  flights = flights[flights[&#39;dest&#39;] == &#34;ORD&#34;]&#xA;  flights = flights[[&#39;carrier&#39;, &#39;dep_delay&#39;, &#39;arr_delay&#39;]]&#xA;  flights = flights.dropna()&#xA;  return flights&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then you can source the script and call the &lt;code&gt;read_flights()&lt;/code&gt; function as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;source_python(&#34;flights.py&#34;)&#xA;flights &amp;lt;- read_flights(&#34;flights.csv&#34;)&#xA;&#xA;library(ggplot2)&#xA;ggplot(flights, aes(carrier, arr_delay)) + geom_point() + geom_jitter()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;code&gt;source_python()&lt;/code&gt; documentation for additional details on sourcing Python code.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Python REPL&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to work with Python interactively you can call the &lt;code&gt;repl_python()&lt;/code&gt; function, which provides a Python REPL embedded within your R session. Objects created within the Python REPL can be accessed from R using the &lt;code&gt;py&lt;/code&gt; object exported from reticulate. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/reticulate/main/man/figures/python_repl.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Enter &lt;code&gt;exit&lt;/code&gt; within the Python REPL to return to the R prompt.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that Python code can also access objects from within the R session using the &lt;code&gt;r&lt;/code&gt; object (e.g. &lt;code&gt;r.flights&lt;/code&gt;). See the &lt;code&gt;repl_python()&lt;/code&gt; documentation for additional details on using the embedded Python REPL.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Type conversions&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When calling into Python, R data types are automatically converted to their equivalent Python types. When values are returned from Python to R they are converted back to R types. Types are converted as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;table&gt; &#xA; &lt;thead&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;R&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;Python&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;Examples&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA; &lt;/thead&gt; &#xA; &lt;tbody&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Single-element vector&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Scalar&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;1&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;1L&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&#34;foo&#34;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Multi-element vector&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;List&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;c(1.0, 2.0, 3.0)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;c(1L, 2L, 3L)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;List of multiple types&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Tuple&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;list(1L, TRUE, &#34;foo&#34;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Named list&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Dict&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;list(a = 1L, b = 2.0)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dict(x = x_data)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Matrix/Array&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;NumPy ndarray&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;matrix(c(1,2,3,4), nrow = 2, ncol = 2)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Data Frame&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Pandas DataFrame&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;data.frame(x = c(1,2,3), y = c(&#34;a&#34;, &#34;b&#34;, &#34;c&#34;))&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Function&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Python function&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;function(x) x + 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;NULL, TRUE, FALSE&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;None, True, False&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;code&gt;NULL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;TRUE&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;FALSE&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA; &lt;/tbody&gt; &#xA;&lt;/table&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a Python object of a custom class is returned then an R reference to that object is returned. You can call methods and access properties of the object just as if it was an instance of an R reference class.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Learning more&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following articles cover the various aspects of using &lt;strong&gt;reticulate&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/calling_python.html&#34;&gt;Calling Python from R&lt;/a&gt; — Describes the various ways to access Python objects from R as well as functions available for more advanced interactions and conversion behavior.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/r_markdown.html&#34;&gt;R Markdown Python Engine&lt;/a&gt; — Provides details on using Python chunks within R Markdown documents, including how call Python code from R chunks and vice-versa.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/versions.html&#34;&gt;Python Version Configuration&lt;/a&gt; — Describes facilities for determining which version of Python is used by reticulate within an R session.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/python_packages.html&#34;&gt;Installing Python Packages&lt;/a&gt; — Documentation on installing Python packages from PyPI or Conda, and managing package installations using virtualenvs and Conda environments.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/package.html&#34;&gt;Using reticulate in an R Package&lt;/a&gt; — Guidelines and best practices for using reticulate in an R package.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/arrays.html&#34;&gt;Arrays in R and Python&lt;/a&gt; — Advanced discussion of the differences between arrays in R and Python and the implications for conversion and interoperability.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.github.io/reticulate/articles/python_primer.html&#34;&gt;Python Primer&lt;/a&gt; — Introduction to Python for R users.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Why reticulate?&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reticulated_python&#34;&gt;Wikipedia&lt;/a&gt; article on the reticulated python:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;The reticulated python is a species of python found in Southeast Asia. They are the world’s longest snakes and longest reptiles…The specific name, reticulatus, is Latin meaning “net-like”, or reticulated, and is a reference to the complex colour pattern.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;From the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/reticulate&#34;&gt;Merriam-Webster&lt;/a&gt; definition of reticulate:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;1: resembling a net or network; especially : having veins, fibers, or lines crossing a reticulate leaf. 2: being or involving evolutionary change dependent on genetic recombination involving diverse interbreeding populations.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The package enables you to &lt;em&gt;reticulate&lt;/em&gt; Python code into R, creating a new breed of project that weaves together the two languages.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

Calculate pairwise comparisons between group levels with corrections for multiple testing.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;br&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Diagnostics of Cox Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;hr&gt; &#xA;&lt;br&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ggcoxzph&lt;/strong&gt;(): Graphical test of proportional hazards. Displays a graph of the scaled Schoenfeld residuals, along with a smooth curve using ggplot2. Wrapper around plot.cox.zph().&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ggcoxdiagnostics&lt;/strong&gt;(): Displays diagnostics graphs presenting goodness of Cox Proportional Hazards Model fit.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ggcoxfunctional&lt;/strong&gt;(): Displays graphs of continuous explanatory variable against martingale residuals of null cox proportional hazards model. It helps to properly choose the functional form of continuous variable in cox model.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;br&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Summary of Cox Model&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;hr&gt; &#xA;&lt;br&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ggforest&lt;/strong&gt;(): Draws forest plot for CoxPH model.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ggcoxadjustedcurves&lt;/strong&gt;(): Plots adjusted survival curves for coxph model.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;br&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Competing Risks&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;hr&gt; &#xA;&lt;br&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ggcompetingrisks&lt;/strong&gt;(): Plots cumulative incidence curves for competing risks.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;br&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;Find out more at &lt;a href=&#34;https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/survminer/&#34; class=&#34;uri&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/survminer/&#34;&gt;https://rpkgs.datanovia.com/survminer/&lt;/a&gt;, and check out the documentation and usage examples of each of the functions in survminer package.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Installation and loading&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Install from &lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/package=survminer&#34;&gt;CRAN&lt;/a&gt; as follow:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;install.packages(&#34;survminer&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, install the latest version from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kassambara/survminer&#34;&gt;GitHub&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;if(!require(devtools)) install.packages(&#34;devtools&#34;)&#xA;devtools::install_github(&#34;kassambara/survminer&#34;, build_vignettes = FALSE)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Load survminer:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;library(&#34;survminer&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;ggsurvplot: Drawing survival curves&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Fitting survival curves&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;require(&#34;survival&#34;)&#xA;fit &amp;lt;- survfit(Surv(time, status) ~ sex, data = lung)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Basic plots&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;ggsurvplot(fit, data = lung)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kassambara/survminer/master/tools/README-ggplot2-basic-survival-plot-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Censor shape can be changed as follow:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;ggsurvplot(fit, data = lung, censor.shape=&#34;|&#34;, censor.size = 4)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Customized survival curves&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;ggsurvplot(&#xA;  fit, &#xA;  data = lung, &#xA;  size = 1,                 # change line size&#xA;  palette = &#xA;    c(&#34;#E7B800&#34;, &#34;#2E9FDF&#34;),# custom color palettes&#xA;  conf.int = TRUE,          # Add confidence interval&#xA;  pval = TRUE,              # Add p-value&#xA;  risk.table = TRUE,        # Add risk table&#xA;  risk.table.col = &#34;strata&#34;,# Risk table color by groups&#xA;  legend.labs = &#xA;    c(&#34;Male&#34;, &#34;Female&#34;),    # Change legend labels&#xA;  risk.table.height = 0.25, # Useful to change when you have multiple groups&#xA;  ggtheme = theme_bw()      # Change ggplot2 theme&#xA;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/kassambara/survminer/master/tools/README-ggplot2-customized-survival-plot-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that, additional arguments are available to customize the main title, axis labels, the font style, axis limits, legends and the number at risk table.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;More customized survival curves&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Focus on &lt;code&gt;xlim&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;break.time.by&lt;/code&gt; parameters which do not change the calculations of estimates of survival surves.

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;R Source Code&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;&#x9;&#x9;THE BASIC R README&#xA;&#xA;&#xA;   (See &#34;doc/FAQ&#34; and &#34;doc/RESOURCES&#34; for more detailed information&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;      - these files are only in the tarballs)&#xA;   (See &#34;INSTALL&#34;             for help on installation)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;INTRODUCTION&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This directory contains the source code tree for R, which is a language which is not entirely unlike (versions 3 and 4 of) the S language developed at AT&amp;amp;T Bell Laboratories by Rick Becker, John Chambers and Allan Wilks.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;R is free software distributed under a GNU-style copyleft.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The core of R is an interpreted computer language with a syntax superficially similar to C, but which is actually a &#34;functional programming language&#34; with capabilities similar to Scheme. The language allows branching and looping as well as modular programming using functions. Most of the user-visible functions in R are written in R, calling upon a smaller set of internal primitives. It is possible for the user to interface to procedures written in C or Fortran languages for efficiency, and also to write additional primitives.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The R distribution contains functionality for a large number of statistical procedures. Among these are: linear and generalized linear models, nonlinear regression models, time series analysis, classical parametric and nonparametric tests, clustering and smoothing. There is also a large set of functions which provide a flexible graphical environment for creating various kinds of data presentations.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;A package specification allows the production of loadable modules for specific purposes, and several thousand contributed packages are made available through the CRAN sites (see &lt;a href=&#34;http://CRAN.R-project.org/mirrors.html&#34;&gt;http://CRAN.R-project.org/mirrors.html&lt;/a&gt; for the current members).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;HISTORY&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;R was initially written by Robert Gentleman and Ross Ihaka of the Statistics Department of the University of Auckland. In addition, a large group of individuals has contributed to R by sending code and bug reports.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since mid-1997 there has been a core group who can modify the R source code archive, listed in file doc/AUTHORS.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;R 1.0.0 was released on 29 February 2000 and 2.0.0 on 4 October 2004. R 3.0.0 came out on 3 April 2013.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This file has been minimally revised since the release of R 1.0.0.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;PRESENT STATUS&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The present version implements most of the functionality in the 1988 book &#34;The New S Language&#34; (the &#34;Blue Book&#34;) and many of the applications. In addition, we have implemented a large part of the functionality from the 1992 book &#34;Statistical Models in S&#34; (the &#34;White Book&#34;) and the 1998 book &#34;Programming with Data&#34; (the &#34;Green Book&#34;).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;All the R functions have been documented in the form of help pages in an &#34;output independent&#34; form which can be used to create versions for HTML, PDF, text etc. A 1900+ page Reference Index (a collection of most of the help pages: there is also a 3300+ page version with all the help pages, including recommended packages) can be obtained in PDF. The manual &lt;code&gt;An Introduction to R&#39; provides a more user-friendly starting point, and there is an FAQ, a draft &lt;/code&gt;R Language Definition&#39; manual and more specialized manuals on admininstration, data import/export and extending R. See INSTALL for instructions on how to generate these documents.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;4&#34;&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;GOALS&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our aim at the start of this project was to demonstrate that it was possible to produce an S-like environment which did not suffer from the memory-demands and performance problems which S has. Somewhat later, we started to turn R into a &#34;real&#34; system, but unfortunately we lost a large part of the efficiency advantage in the process, so have revised the memory management mechanism and implemented delayed loading of R objects. A lot of performance tuning has been done, including the ability to use tuned linear-algebra libraries.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Longer-term goals include to explore new ideas: e.g. virtual objects and component-based programming, and expanding the scope of existing ones like formula-based interfaces. Further, we wish to get a handle on a general approach to graphical user interfaces (preferably with cross-platform portability), and to develop better 3-D and dynamic graphics.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sincerely, The R Core Team.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
