    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Equipment Loss Tracking&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Russia-Ukraine War&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using data from &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.oryxspioenkop.com/2022/02/attack-on-europe-documenting-equipment.html&#34;&gt;Oryx&#39;s site&lt;/a&gt;, I&#39;ve put together a quick tracker to visualize equipment losses since &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russo-Ukrainian_War&#34;&gt;Russia&#39;s February 24th invasion of Ukraine&lt;/a&gt;. This is only equipment that is independently verified, as noted by Oryx:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;This list only includes destroyed vehicles and equipment of which photo or videographic evidence is available. Therefore, the amount of equipment destroyed is significantly higher than recorded here. Small arms, munitions, civilian vehicles, trailers and derelict equipment (including aircraft) are not included in this list. All possible effort has gone into discerning the status of equipment between captured or abandoned. Many of the entries listed as &#39;abandoned&#39; will likely end up captured or destroyed. Similarly, some of the captured equipment might be destroyed if it can&#39;t be recovered. ATGMs and MANPADS are included in the list but not included in the ultimate count. The Soviet flag is used when the equipment in question was produced prior to 1991.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Data is drawn from &lt;a href=&#34;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bngHbR0YPS7XH1oSA1VxoL4R34z60SJcR3NxguZM9GI/edit?usp=sharing&#34;&gt;this public google sheet&lt;/a&gt; which is updated based on the last update for each day. As such it is a lagging indicator, dependent not just on when equipment is lost, but when it is discovered and documented.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Data is pulled daily from Oryx&#39;s site using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/scarnecchia&#34;&gt;Daniel Scarnecchia&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/scarnecchia/scrape_oryx&#34;&gt;scraper tool&lt;/a&gt;, and then pushed to the public google sheet, where synthetic calculations are performed for equipment categories (to presere transparency).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Points (red = Russia, blue = Ukraine) represent cumulative losses for each day, bars represent daily losses. The line repreents a general additive model smooth on cumulative losses to date; the shaded grey band represents the 95% confidence interval based on extant variation (e.g. point scatter). A wider grey band means more uncertainty, a narrower grey band means less uncertainty.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please keep in mind that this is empirical, not inteptetive, analysis. A concern raised about the available data is that it undercounts Ukrainian losses. This is possible not just because of bias (note pro-Russian sources are monitered as well) but because areas under Russian control are less likely to have photo documentation. Fog of war is very real. There is no attempt here to use a modifier to adjust numbers - analysis is strictly empirical. Any bias in the origional data will be reflected in the following analyses.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Total Equipment Losses&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_total.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Ukranian and Russian equipment losses started off equivalent, but Russians quickly began to lose more equipment by the third day of the war.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Maps&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Map data is provided using a google maps base layer with troop locations from &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/HN_Schlottman&#34;&gt;Henry Schlottman&lt;/a&gt;&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/simonhuwiler/uawardata&#34;&gt;GitHub repo&lt;/a&gt;. Fire data comes from &lt;a href=&#34;https://firms.modaps.eosdis.nasa.gov&#34;&gt;NASA FIRMS&lt;/a&gt; VIIRS sattelite.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Battle of Kyiv&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Maps/battleofkyiv.gif?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; The [Battle of Kyiv](&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kyiv_(2022)&#34;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Kyiv_(2022)&lt;/a&gt; concluded at the beginning of April 2022 in a Ukrainan victory. NASA FIRMS analysis indicates that the majority of detectible fire from fighting was in the last two weeks of the conflict (March 15th - April 1st).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Donbas and Kharkiv&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Maps/donbas_map.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Russia has concentrated most of its combat forces in the Donbas attempting to breakthrough Ukranian lines established in 2014. FIRMS fire data indicates battles around Izyum, with some progress for Russia to the west.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Maps/battleofdonbas.gif?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; The [Battle of the Donbas](&lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Donbas_(2022)&#34;&gt;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Donbas_(2022)&lt;/a&gt; has only shown a distinct FIRMS signature since the first week of May, indicating heavy fires all around.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Kherson&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Maps/kherson_map.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Kherson is an occupied city where the Russian advance was halted. FIRMS data does not indicate heavy combat in the area currently.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;FIRMS Summary&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/firms_summary_plot.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Summing megawatts of energy radiated from regions of Ukraine helps highlight the independent war record. The Battle of Kyiv is clearly visible, with detectable fires concentrated in the last two weeks (March 15th - April 1st). The Battle of Donbas, following a repositioning of Russian forces, shows a more brief but just as intense spike in radiation confined to the first two weeks of May.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Destroyed Equipment&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_destroyed.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Destroyed Russian equipment outpaced destroyed Ukranian equipment by the second day of the war, though there are signs it is starting to taper.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Abandoned Equipment&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_abandoned.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Ukranians abandoned equipment more readily in the early days fo the war, but by the third day this rate plateaued. Russian abandonments increased sharply on the third day, and began to taper at the end of the first week.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Captured Equipment&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_captured.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Russians have seen a much higher rate of equipment capture since the start of the war, with a sharp increase in the second week, though this has begun to taper by the start of the third week.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The degree to which Russians have lost more equipment (in every category type) is very striking. It is certaintly possible this is a product of Ukranians focusing on documenting Russian losses, though this can&#39;t be a complete explanation.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Equipment Net Changes&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_absolute_total.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; This calculation subtracts units captured by each combatant with their other loss types (destroyed, damaged, and abandoned). It is arguable if a proportion of abandonded should be included as captures. Ukraine has a net positive change in equipment - meaning they&#39;ve captured more than they&#39;ve lost. Russia however has lost many more units than it has aquired from Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Ratios&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/ratio_grid.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; This plot shows the ratios of losses (e.g. proportion of total) for Russia and Ukraine for each loss type.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Refugees&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;These data are gathered by the United Nations High Commissioner on Refugees (UNHCR) operational data portal (ODP) &lt;a href=&#34;https://data2.unhcr.org/en/situations/ukraine&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. The line represents total refugees, while the bars below indicate daily totals.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/refugees_total.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Refugee outflows peaked on the 7th of March, but migration continues to be heavy. Refugees are primarily destined for Poland initially, though other nearby countries such as Moldova and Hungary are taking large numbers as well. This only counts migration out of Ukraine - internal displacement of &lt;a href=&#34;https://displacement.iom.int/reports/ukraine-internal-displacement-report-general-population-survey-round-2-24-march-1-april&#34;&gt;7.1 million people&lt;/a&gt; has occured since the conflict began. All together over 25% of Ukraine&#39;s population, or more than 1 out of every 4 Ukrainians, has had to move since the war began.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Raw Equipment Losses&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#34;Raw&#34; refers to a specific type of vehicle, such as a tank or armored personell carrier&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Tanks&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_tanks.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Tank losses were equivalent in the first four days of the war, with Russian tank loses increasing sharpely thereafter, though a jump in Ukranian tank losses can be seen at the start of the second week of the war.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_percent_total_tanks.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; This graph, however, highlights the challenges Ukraine still faces. When the sheer scale of &lt;a href=&#34;https://inews.co.uk/news/world/russia-tanks-how-many-putin-armoured-forces-ukraine-nato-explained-1504470&#34;&gt;Russian tanks&lt;/a&gt; are considered (13,300 vs. 2,100 for Ukraine), the steep Russian losses are not yet bringing parity. In general, Ukraine loses 1 tank for every 3 it takes from Russia. This ratio has to get to 4 or higher to be sustainble. Note that this estimate factors in verified tank captures by both Russia and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_percent_deployed_tanks.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; If we consider estimates of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.as.com/en/2022/02/24/latest_news/1645729870_894320.html&#34;&gt;deployed Russian tanks&lt;/a&gt; instead of their total (2,840 vs. 2,100 for Ukraine), the picture is not as dire for Ukraine. This estimate likely is closer to the battlefont picture, as not all Russian tanks could be deployed at once, though Russia can sustain attrition longer than Ukraine. Note that this estimate factors in verified tank captures by both Russia and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_percent_total_tanks_baseline.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; If we consider estimates of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.as.com/en/2022/02/24/latest_news/1645729870_894320.html&#34;&gt;deployed Russian tanks&lt;/a&gt; fixed to their total inventory, it is clear that Ukraine is adding to its tank fleet near the rate Russia is losing theirs. Though note that this measure assumes Russia has the capability to use all 13,300 of its tanks in Ukraine if needed.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_percent_deployed_tanks_baseline.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; If we consider estimates of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.as.com/en/2022/02/24/latest_news/1645729870_894320.html&#34;&gt;deployed Russian tanks&lt;/a&gt; fixed to their starting number, the picture is considerably more positive for Ukraine. Instead of recording only losses, this fixes the baseline (2,840 for Russia vs. 2,100 for Ukraine) and factors both tank losses and gains (e.g. captures). By this metric Russia has lost well over 5% of its tanks while Ukraine has supplemented its by 2% (e.g. captured more than it has lost).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Armored Fighting Vehicles (AFV)&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_afv.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Armored Fighting Vehicles also see parity in losses in the first 4 days of the war, though Russian losses increase less dramatically than is seen with tanks. Note that this estimate factors in verified AFV captures by both Russia and Ukraine.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_percent_afv.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; When normalized to standing inventory, Russia&#39;s losses are a less significant fraction of their total inventory compared to Ukraine. This higlhights the steep challenge Ukraine faces. In general, Ukraine loses 1 AFV for every 3 it takes from Russia. This ratio has to get to 4 or higher to be sustainble.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_percent_total_afv_baseline.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; If we consider estimates of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.as.com/en/2022/02/24/latest_news/1645729870_894320.html&#34;&gt;deployed Russian AFV&lt;/a&gt; fixed to their total inventory, Ukraine is adding modestly to its AFV inventory at the same rate which Russia is losing its AFV.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Artillery&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_artillery.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; The ratio of Russian to Ukrainian artillery losses is 3:1, though Russia&#39;s losses have plateued since the first week of April.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Infantry Fighting Vehicles (IFV)&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_ifv.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Ukranian&#39;s lost more Infrantry Fighting Vehicles in the first two days of the war, with Russian losses acellerating linearly until the end of the second week.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Armored Personel Carriers (APC)&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_apc.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Ukranian&#39;s lost more Armored Personel Carriers in the first two days of the war, with Russian losses acellerating linearly until the end of the second week, though the differential is less dramatic than with AFVs.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Infantry Mobility Vehicles (IMV)&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_imv.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Infantry Mobility Vehicle losses are more or less equivalent between Ukranian and Russian forces through the first two weeks of the war.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Synthetic Equipment Losses&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&#34;Synthetic&#34; refers to a combination of vehicle types to form a theme - such as aircraft (fighters + helicopters + drones) or anti-aircraft (SAM + MANPADS), etc.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Aircraft&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_aircraft.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Ukranians have lost aircraft linearly, while Russians lost them almost exponentially in teh first two weeks of the war, though there are signs this is tapering sharpely. This calculation includes fighters, helicotpers, and drones.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Anti-air&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_antiair.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Ukranians sustained higher rates of loss of anti-air systems through the first week of the war, though Russian losses have since outpaced them by the second week of the war. This calculation includes MANPADS, SAMs, self-propelled anti-aircraft guns, radar, and jamming systems.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Armor&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_armor.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Russian and Ukranian armor losses were equivalent in the first three days of the war, with Russian losses significantly outpacing Ukranians since. This calculaton includes both tanks and armored fighting vehicles.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_percent_total_armor_baseline.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; If we consider estimates of &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.as.com/en/2022/02/24/latest_news/1645729870_894320.html&#34;&gt;deployed Russian armor&lt;/a&gt; fixed to their total inventory, Ukraine is adding modestly to its armor inventory at the same rate which Russia is losing its Armor.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Infantry&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_infantry.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Infantry losses were higher among Ukranians at the start of the war, with Russian losses increasing sharply since then. Ukranian losses taper in the second week. This calculation includes infantry fighting vehicles, armored personell carriers, and infantry mobility vehicles.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Vehicles (standard transportation)&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_vehicles.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Ukranians lost more vehicles on the first day, with Russian losses accelerating since then. This calculation includes all non-specialized vehicle types.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Logistics Systems&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_logistics.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Ukranians have lost few logistics systems, while Russian losses increased linearly until the end of the second when they began to taper. This calculation includes engineering and communications vehicles.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;#Analysis By grouping synthetic vehicles, we can see how different systems have been prioritized by Russian or Ukranians, providing a glimpse into strategy.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Loss Type&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_loss_type.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; These ratio plots use Russian equipment losses as the numerator and Ukranian losses as the denominator. The higher the bar, the higher the proportion of Russian losses. While Russians have abandoned vehicles at a higher rate, destructions remain the highest differential between the two armies.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Unit Type&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/leedrake5/Russia-Ukraine/master/Plots/current_unit_type.jpg?&#34; alt=&#34;alt text&#34;&gt; Here, Ukranian strategy is abundantly clear. It has targeted Russian logistics operations (higher bar = more Russian losses) to an overwhelming degree. Russians have focused on anti-air systems (lower bar = more Ukranian losses), though remarkably despite this focus Ukranian&#39;s still have an almost 2-1 edge on taking these systems out.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Conclusions&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;I am not a military expert, but by the second week of the war it is clear that the Russian objective of suppressing Ukranian aircraft and anti-air failed, leading to contested airspace. In contrast, Ukranian&#39;s succeeded in interfering with Russian logistics, evidenced by their focus on logistics vehicles and fuel lines. This has ground the Russian advance to a halt by the third day, with limited change since then.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

For example,&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;options(languageserver.snippet_support = FALSE)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;will turn off snippet support globally. LSP configuration settings are always overriden by &lt;code&gt;options()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Linters&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;With &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/r-lib/lintr&#34;&gt;lintr&lt;/a&gt; v2.0.0, the linters can be specified by creating the &lt;code&gt;.lintr&lt;/code&gt; file at the project or home directory. Details can be found at lintr &lt;a href=&#34;https://lintr.r-lib.org/articles/lintr.html&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Customizing server capabilities&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Server capabilities are defined in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/REditorSupport/languageserver/raw/master/R/capabilities.R&#34;&gt;capabilities.R&lt;/a&gt;. Users could override the capabilities by specifying the LSP configuration setting &lt;code&gt;server_capabilities&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;options(languageserver.server_capabilities)&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;code&gt;.Rprofile&lt;/code&gt;. For example, to turn off &lt;code&gt;definitionProvider&lt;/code&gt;, one could either use LSP configuration&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-json&#34;&gt;&#34;r&#34;: {&#xA;    &#34;lsp&#34;: {&#xA;        &#34;server_capabilities&#34;: {&#xA;            &#34;definitionProvider&#34;: false&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;or R options&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;options(&#xA;    languageserver.server_capabilities = list(&#xA;        definitionProvider = FALSE&#xA;    )&#xA;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Customizing formatting style&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The language server uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/r-lib/styler&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;styler&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; to perform code formatting. It uses &lt;code&gt;styler::tidyverse_style(indent_by = options$tabSize)&lt;/code&gt; as the default style where &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-14/#textDocument_formatting&#34;&gt;formatting options&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The formatting style can be customized by specifying &lt;code&gt;languageserver.formatting_style&lt;/code&gt; option which is supposed to be a function that accepts an &lt;code&gt;options&lt;/code&gt; argument mentioned above. You could consider to put the code in &lt;code&gt;.Rprofile&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://styler.r-lib.org/reference/tidyverse_style.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;styler::tidyverse_style&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; provides numerous arguments to customize the formatting behavior. For example, to make it only work at indention scope:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;options(languageserver.formatting_style = function(options) {&#xA;    styler::tidyverse_style(scope = &#34;indention&#34;, indent_by = options$tabSize)&#xA;})&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To disable assignment operator fix (replacing &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;options(languageserver.formatting_style = function(options) {&#xA;    style &amp;lt;- styler::tidyverse_style(indent_by = options$tabSize)&#xA;    style$token$force_assignment_op &amp;lt;- NULL&#xA;    style&#xA;})&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To further customize the formatting style, please refer to &lt;a href=&#34;https://styler.r-lib.org/articles/customizing_styler.html&#34;&gt;Customizing styler&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Statistical Rethinking course and book package&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;rethinking&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This R package accompanies a course and book on Bayesian data analysis: McElreath 2020. Statistical Rethinking, 2nd edition, CRC Press. If you are using it with the first edition of the book, please see the notes at the bottom of this file.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;It contains tools for conducting both quick quadratic approximation of the posterior distribution as well as Hamiltonian Monte Carlo (through RStan or cmdstanr - mc-stan.org). Many packages do this. The signature difference of this package is that it forces the user to specify the model as a list of explicit distributional assumptions. This is more tedious than typical formula-based tools, but it is also much more flexible and powerful and---most important---useful for teaching and learning. When students have to write out every detail of the model, they actually learn the model.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, a simple Gaussian model could be specified with this list of formulas:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;f &amp;lt;- alist(&#xA;    y ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ),&#xA;    mu ~ dnorm( 0 , 10 ),&#xA;    sigma ~ dexp( 1 )&#xA;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The first formula in the list is the probability of the outcome (likelihood); the second is the prior for &lt;code&gt;mu&lt;/code&gt;; the third is the prior for &lt;code&gt;sigma&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Installation&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are three steps. (1) Install &lt;code&gt;rstan&lt;/code&gt;, (2) install &lt;code&gt;cmdstanr&lt;/code&gt;, (3) install &lt;code&gt;rethinking&lt;/code&gt;. Details follow.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;First, install the C++ toolchain and install the &lt;code&gt;rstan&lt;/code&gt; package. Go to &lt;code&gt;https://mc-stan.org/users/interfaces/rstan.html&lt;/code&gt; and follow the instructions for your platform. The biggest challenge is getting a C++ compiler configured to work with your installation of R. The instructions are quite thorough. Obey them, and you&#39;ll succeed.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Second, install the &lt;code&gt;cmdstanr&lt;/code&gt; package. Visit &lt;code&gt;https://mc-stan.org/cmdstanr/&lt;/code&gt;. The first time you install cmdstanr, you will also need compile the libraries with &lt;code&gt;cmdstanr::install_cmdstan()&lt;/code&gt;. All this of this bother is worth it. You just have to do it once.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Third, once rstan and cmdstanr are installed (almost there), then you can install &lt;code&gt;rethinking&lt;/code&gt; from within R using:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;install.packages(c(&#34;coda&#34;,&#34;mvtnorm&#34;,&#34;devtools&#34;,&#34;loo&#34;,&#34;dagitty&#34;,&#34;shape&#34;))&#xA;devtools::install_github(&#34;rmcelreath/rethinking&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If there are any problems, they likely arise when trying to install &lt;code&gt;rstan&lt;/code&gt;, so the &lt;code&gt;rethinking&lt;/code&gt; package has little to do with it. See the manual linked above for some hints about getting &lt;code&gt;rstan&lt;/code&gt; installed. But always consult the RStan section of the website at &lt;code&gt;mc-stan.org&lt;/code&gt; for the latest information on RStan.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that the &lt;code&gt;rethinking&lt;/code&gt; package is not on CRAN, just on github. The &lt;code&gt;rethinking&lt;/code&gt; package is never going to be on CRAN.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;rethinking slim - no MCMC&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you just want to work through the first half of the course, without bothering with MCMC and Stan installs, you can install the &#39;slim&#39; version of the rethinking package. Do this:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;install.packages(c(&#34;coda&#34;,&#34;mvtnorm&#34;,&#34;devtools&#34;,&#34;loo&#34;,&#34;dagitty&#34;))&#xA;devtools::install_github(&#34;rmcelreath/rethinking@slim&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;quap&lt;/code&gt; function and related helper functions should still work, and you&#39;ll be able to work through Chapter 8 before you need to install the full version with Stan.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Quadratic Approximation with &lt;code&gt;quap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Almost any ordinary generalized linear model can be specified with &lt;code&gt;quap&lt;/code&gt;. To use quadratic approximation:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(rethinking)&#xA;&#xA;f &amp;lt;- alist(&#xA;    y ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ),&#xA;    mu ~ dnorm( 0 , 10 ),&#xA;    sigma ~ dexp( 1 )&#xA;)&#xA;&#xA;fit &amp;lt;- quap( &#xA;    f , &#xA;    data=list(y=c(-1,1)) , &#xA;    start=list(mu=0,sigma=1)&#xA;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The object &lt;code&gt;fit&lt;/code&gt; holds the result. For a summary of marginal posterior distributions, use &lt;code&gt;summary(fit)&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;precis(fit)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;      mean   sd  5.5% 94.5%&#xA;mu    0.00 0.59 -0.95  0.95&#xA;sigma 0.84 0.33  0.31  1.36&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;It also supports vectorized parameters, which is convenient for categories. See examples &lt;code&gt;?quap&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the first edition of the textbook, this function was called &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;. It can still be used with that alias. It was renamed, because the name &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; was misleading. This function produces quadratic approximations of the posterior distribution, not just maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Hamiltonian Monte Carlo with &lt;code&gt;ulam&lt;/code&gt; (and &lt;code&gt;map2stan&lt;/code&gt;)&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same formula list can be compiled into a Stan (mc-stan.org) model using one of two tools: &lt;code&gt;ulam&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;map2stan&lt;/code&gt;. For simple models, they are identical. &lt;code&gt;ulam&lt;/code&gt; is the newer tool that allows for much more flexibility, including explicit variable types and custom distributions. &lt;code&gt;map2stan&lt;/code&gt; is the original tool from the first edition of the package and textbook. Going forward, new features will be added to &lt;code&gt;ulam&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ulam&lt;/code&gt; is named after Stanisław Ulam, who was one of the parents of the Monte Carlo method and is the namesake of the Stan project as well. It is pronounced something like [OO-lahm], not like [YOU-lamm].&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both tools take the same kind of input as &lt;code&gt;quap&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;fit_stan &amp;lt;- ulam( f , data=list(y=c(-1,1)) )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The chain runs automatically, provided &lt;code&gt;rstan&lt;/code&gt; is installed. Chain diagnostics are displayed in the &lt;code&gt;precis(fit_stan)&lt;/code&gt; output:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;      mean   sd  5.5% 94.5% n_eff Rhat&#xA;sigma 1.45 0.72  0.67  2.84   145    1&#xA;mu    0.12 1.04 -1.46  1.59   163    1&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For &lt;code&gt;ulam&lt;/code&gt; models, &lt;code&gt;plot&lt;/code&gt; displays the same information as &lt;code&gt;precis&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;traceplot&lt;/code&gt; displays the chains.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;extract.samples&lt;/code&gt; returns samples in a list. &lt;code&gt;extract.prior&lt;/code&gt; samples from the prior and returns the samples in a list as well.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;stanfit&lt;/code&gt; object itself is in the &lt;code&gt;@stanfit&lt;/code&gt; slot. Anything you&#39;d do with a Stan model can be done with that slot directly.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Stan code can be accessed by using &lt;code&gt;stancode(fit_stan)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;data{&#xA;    real y[2];&#xA;}&#xA;parameters{&#xA;    real&amp;lt;lower=0&amp;gt; sigma;&#xA;    real mu;&#xA;}&#xA;model{&#xA;    sigma ~ exponential( 1 );&#xA;    mu ~ normal( 0 , 10 );&#xA;    y ~ normal( mu , sigma );&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that &lt;code&gt;ulam&lt;/code&gt; doesn&#39;t care about R distribution names. You can instead use Stan-style names:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;fit_stan &amp;lt;- ulam(&#xA;    alist(&#xA;        y ~ normal( mu , sigma ),&#xA;        mu ~ normal( 0 , 10 ),&#xA;        sigma ~ exponential( 1 )&#xA;    ), data=list(y=c(-1,1)) )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Posterior prediction&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;All &lt;code&gt;quap&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ulam&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;map2stan&lt;/code&gt; objects can be post-processed to produce posterior predictive distributions.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt; is used to compute values of any linear models over samples from the posterior distribution.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;sim&lt;/code&gt; is used to simulate posterior predictive distributions, simulating outcomes over samples from the posterior distribution of parameters. &lt;code&gt;sim&lt;/code&gt; can also be used to simulate prior predictives.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;code&gt;?link&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;?sim&lt;/code&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;postcheck&lt;/code&gt; automatically computes posterior predictive (retrodictive?) checks. It merely uses &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sim&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Multilevel model formulas&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;code&gt;quap&lt;/code&gt; is limited to fixed effects models for the most part, &lt;code&gt;ulam&lt;/code&gt; can specify multilevel models, even quite complex ones. For example, a simple varying intercepts model looks like:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# prep data&#xA;data( UCBadmit )&#xA;UCBadmit$male &amp;lt;- as.integer(UCBadmit$applicant.gender==&#34;male&#34;)&#xA;UCBadmit$dept &amp;lt;- rep( 1:6 , each=2 )&#xA;UCBadmit$applicant.gender &amp;lt;- NULL&#xA;&#xA;# varying intercepts model&#xA;m_glmm1 &amp;lt;- ulam(&#xA;    alist(&#xA;        admit ~ binomial(applications,p),&#xA;        logit(p) &amp;lt;- a[dept] + b*male,&#xA;        a[dept] ~ normal( abar , sigma ),&#xA;        abar ~ normal( 0 , 4 ),&#xA;        sigma ~ half_normal(0,1),&#xA;        b ~ normal(0,1)&#xA;    ), data=UCBadmit )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The analogous varying slopes model is:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;m_glmm2 &amp;lt;- ulam(&#xA;    alist(&#xA;        admit ~ binomial(applications,p),&#xA;        logit(p) &amp;lt;- a[dept] + b[dept]*male,&#xA;        c( a , b )[dept] ~ multi_normal( c(abar,bbar) , Rho , sigma ),&#xA;        abar ~ normal( 0 , 4 ),&#xA;        bbar ~ normal(0,1),&#xA;        sigma ~ half_normal(0,1),&#xA;        Rho ~ lkjcorr(2)&#xA;    ),&#xA;    data=UCBadmit )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another way to express the varying slopes model is with a vector of varying effects. This is made possible by using an explicit vector declaration inside the formula:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;m_glmm3 &amp;lt;- ulam(&#xA;    alist(&#xA;        admit ~ binomial(applications,p),&#xA;        logit(p) &amp;lt;- v[dept,1] + v[dept,2]*male,&#xA;        vector[2]:v[dept] ~ multi_normal( c(abar,bbar) , Rho , sigma ),&#xA;        abar ~ normal( 0 , 4 ),&#xA;        bbar ~ normal(0,1),&#xA;        sigma ~ half_normal(0,1),&#xA;        Rho ~ lkjcorr(2)&#xA;    ),&#xA;    data=UCBadmit )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;That &lt;code&gt;vector[2]:v[dept]&lt;/code&gt; means &#34;declare a vector of length two for each unique dept&#34;. To access the elements of these vectors, the linear model uses multiple indexes inside the brackets: &lt;code&gt;[dept,1]&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This strategy can be taken one step further and the means can be declared as a vector as well:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;m_glmm4 &amp;lt;- ulam(&#xA;    alist(&#xA;        admit ~ binomial(applications,p),&#xA;        logit(p) &amp;lt;- v[dept,1] + v[dept,2]*male,&#xA;        vector[2]:v[dept] ~ multi_normal( v_mu , Rho , sigma ),&#xA;        vector[2]:v_mu ~ normal(0,1),&#xA;        sigma[1] ~ half_normal(0,1),&#xA;        sigma[2] ~ half_normal(0,2),&#xA;        Rho ~ lkjcorr(2)&#xA;    ),&#xA;    data=UCBadmit )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;And a completely non-centered parameterization can be coded directly as well:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;m_glmm5 &amp;lt;- ulam(&#xA;    alist(&#xA;        admit ~ binomial(applications,p),&#xA;        logit(p) &amp;lt;- v_mu[1] + v[dept,1] + (v_mu[2] + v[dept,2])*male,&#xA;        matrix[dept,2]: v &amp;lt;- t(diag_pre_multiply( sigma , L_Rho ) * z),&#xA;        matrix[2,dept]: z ~ normal( 0 , 1 ),&#xA;        vector[2]: v_mu[[1]] ~ normal(0,4),&#xA;        vector[2]: v_mu[[2]] ~ normal(0,1),&#xA;        vector[2]: sigma ~ half_normal(0,1),&#xA;        cholesky_factor_corr[2]: L_Rho ~ lkj_corr_cholesky( 2 )&#xA;    ),&#xA;    data=UCBadmit )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the above, the varying effects matrix &lt;code&gt;v&lt;/code&gt; is constructed from a matrix of z-scores &lt;code&gt;z&lt;/code&gt; and a covariance structure contained in &lt;code&gt;sigma&lt;/code&gt; and a Cholesky factor &lt;code&gt;L_Rho&lt;/code&gt;. Note the double-bracket notation &lt;code&gt;v_mu[[1]]&lt;/code&gt; allowing distinct priors for each index of a vector.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;log-likelihood calculations for WAIC and LOOCV&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ulam&lt;/code&gt; can optionally return pointwise log-likelihood values. These are needed for computing WAIC and PSIS-LOO. The &lt;code&gt;log_lik&lt;/code&gt; argument toggles this on:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;m_glmm1 &amp;lt;- ulam(&#xA;    alist(&#xA;        admit ~ binomial(applications,p),&#xA;        logit(p) &amp;lt;- a[dept] + b*male,&#xA;        a[dept] ~ normal( abar , sigma ),&#xA;        abar ~ normal( 0 , 4 ),&#xA;        sigma ~ half_normal(0,1),&#xA;        b ~ normal(0,1)&#xA;    ), data=UCBadmit , log_lik=TRUE )&#xA;WAIC(m_glmm1)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The additional code has been added to the generated quantities block of the Stan model (see this with &lt;code&gt;stancode(m_glmm1)&lt;/code&gt;):&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;generated quantities{&#xA;    vector[12] log_lik;&#xA;    vector[12] p;&#xA;    for ( i in 1:12 ) {&#xA;        p[i] = a[dept[i]] + b * male[i];&#xA;        p[i] = inv_logit(p[i]);&#xA;    }&#xA;    for ( i in 1:12 ) log_lik[i] = binomial_lpmf( admit[i] | applications[i] , p[i] );&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Conditional statements, custom distributions, and mixture models&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ulam&lt;/code&gt; also supports if-then statements and custom distribution assignments. These are useful for coding mixture models, such as zero-inflated Poisson and discrete missing value models.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an example zero-inflated Poisson model.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;# zero-inflated poisson&#xA;# gen data first - example from text&#xA;prob_drink &amp;lt;- 0.2 # 20% of days&#xA;rate_work &amp;lt;- 1    # average 1 manuscript per day&#xA;N &amp;lt;- 365&#xA;drink &amp;lt;- rbinom( N , 1 , prob_drink )&#xA;y &amp;lt;- as.integer( (1-drink)*rpois( N , rate_work ) )&#xA;x &amp;lt;- rnorm( N ) # dummy covariate&#xA;&#xA;# now ulam code&#xA;m_zip &amp;lt;- ulam(&#xA;    alist(&#xA;        y|y==0 ~ custom( log_mix( p , 0 , poisson_lpmf(0|lambda) ) ),&#xA;        y|y&amp;gt;0 ~ custom( log1m(p) + poisson_lpmf(y|lambda) ),&#xA;        logit(p) &amp;lt;- ap,&#xA;        log(lambda) &amp;lt;- al + bl*x,&#xA;        ap ~ dnorm(0,1),&#xA;        al ~ dnorm(0,10),&#xA;        bl ~ normal(0,1)&#xA;    ) ,&#xA;    data=list(y=y,x=x) )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Stan code corresponding to the first two lines in the formula above is:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;for ( i in 1:365 ) &#xA;    if ( y[i] &amp;gt; 0 ) target += log1m(p) + poisson_lpmf(y[i] | lambda[i]);&#xA;for ( i in 1:365 ) &#xA;    if ( y[i] == 0 ) target += log_mix(p, 0, poisson_lpmf(0 | lambda[i]));&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;What &lt;code&gt;custom&lt;/code&gt; does is define custom &lt;code&gt;target&lt;/code&gt; updates. And the &lt;code&gt;|&lt;/code&gt; operator makes the line conditional. Note that &lt;code&gt;log1m&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;log_mix&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;poisson_lpmf&lt;/code&gt; are Stan functions.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The same &lt;code&gt;custom&lt;/code&gt; distribution approach allows for marginalization over discrete missing values. Let&#39;s introduce some missing values in the &lt;code&gt;UCBadmit&lt;/code&gt; data from earlier.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;UCBadmit$male2 &amp;lt;- UCBadmit$male&#xA;UCBadmit$male2[1:2] &amp;lt;- (-1) # missingness code&#xA;UCBadmit$male2 &amp;lt;- as.integer(UCBadmit$male2)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now the model needs to detect when &lt;code&gt;male2&lt;/code&gt; is missing (-1) and then compute a mixture over the unknown state.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;m_mix &amp;lt;- ulam(&#xA;    alist(&#xA;        admit|male2==-1 ~ custom( log_mix( &#xA;            phi_male , &#xA;            binomial_lpmf(admit|applications,p_m1) , &#xA;            binomial_lpmf(admit|applications,p_m0) ) ),&#xA;        admit|male2&amp;gt;-1 ~ binomial( applications , p ),&#xA;        logit(p) &amp;lt;- a[dept] + b*male2,&#xA;        logit(p_m1) &amp;lt;- a[dept] + b*1,&#xA;        logit(p_m0) &amp;lt;- a[dept] + b*0,&#xA;        male2|male2&amp;gt;-1 ~ bernoulli( phi_male ),&#xA;        phi_male ~ beta(2,2),&#xA;        a[dept] ~ normal(0,4),&#xA;        b ~ normal(0,1)&#xA;    ),&#xA;    data=UCBadmit )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note the addition of &lt;code&gt;phi_male&lt;/code&gt; to average over the unknown state.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Continuous missing data imputation&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In principle, imputation of missing real-valued data is easy: Just replace each missing value with a parameter. In practice, this involves a bunch of annoying bookkeeping. &lt;code&gt;ulam&lt;/code&gt; has a macro named &lt;code&gt;merge_missing&lt;/code&gt; to simplify this.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;UCBadmit$x &amp;lt;- rnorm(12)&#xA;UCBadmit$x[1:2] &amp;lt;- NA&#xA;m_miss &amp;lt;- ulam(&#xA;    alist(&#xA;        admit ~ binomial(applications,p),&#xA;        logit(p) &amp;lt;- a + b*male + bx*x_merge,&#xA;        x_merge ~ normal( 0 , 1 ),&#xA;        x_merge &amp;lt;- merge_missing( x , x_impute ),&#xA;        a ~ normal(0,4),&#xA;        b ~ normal(0,1),&#xA;        bx ~ normal(0,1)&#xA;    ),&#xA;    data=UCBadmit )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;What &lt;code&gt;merge_missing&lt;/code&gt; does is find the &lt;code&gt;NA&lt;/code&gt; values in &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; (whichever symbol is the first argument), build a vector of parameters called &lt;code&gt;x_impute&lt;/code&gt; (whatever you name the second argument) of the right length, and piece together a vector &lt;code&gt;x_merge&lt;/code&gt; that contains both, in the right places. You can then assign a prior to this vector and use it in linear models as usual.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The merging is done as the Stan model runs, using a custom function block. See the Stan code &lt;code&gt;stancode(m_miss)&lt;/code&gt; for all the lovely details.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;merge missing&lt;/code&gt; is an example of a macro, which is a way for &lt;code&gt;ulam&lt;/code&gt; to use function names to trigger special compilation. In this case, &lt;code&gt;merge_missing&lt;/code&gt; both inserts a function in the Stan model and builds the necessary index to locate the missing values during run time. Macros will get full documentation later, once the system is finalized.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Gaussian processes&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;A simple Gaussian process, like the Oceanic islands example in Chapter 13 of the book, is done as:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;data(Kline2)&#xA;d &amp;lt;- Kline2&#xA;data(islandsDistMatrix)&#xA;d$society &amp;lt;- 1:10&#xA;dat &amp;lt;- list(&#xA;    y=d$total_tools,&#xA;    society=d$society,&#xA;    log_pop = log(d$population),&#xA;    Dmat=islandsDistMatrix&#xA;)&#xA;&#xA;m_GP1 &amp;lt;- ulam(&#xA;    alist(&#xA;        y ~ poisson( mu ),&#xA;        log(mu) &amp;lt;- a + aj[society] + b*log_pop,&#xA;        a ~ normal(0,10),&#xA;        b ~ normal(0,1),&#xA;        vector[10]: aj ~ multi_normal( 0 , SIGMA ),&#xA;        matrix[10,10]: SIGMA &amp;lt;- cov_GPL2( Dmat , etasq , rhosq , 0.01 ),&#xA;        etasq ~ exponential(1),&#xA;        rhosq ~ exponential(1)&#xA;    ),&#xA;    data=dat )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is just an ordinary varying intercepts model, but all 10 intercepts are drawn from a single Gaussian distribution. The covariance matrix &lt;code&gt;SIGMA&lt;/code&gt; is defined in the usual L2-norm. Again, &lt;code&gt;cov_GPL2&lt;/code&gt; is a macro that inserts a function in the Stan code to compute the covariance matrix as the model runs.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Fancier Gaussian processes require a different parameterization. And these can be built as well. Here&#39;s an example using 151 primate species and a phylogenetic distance matrix. First, prepare the data:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;data(Primates301)&#xA;data(Primates301_distance_matrix)&#xA;d &amp;lt;- Primates301&#xA;d$name &amp;lt;- as.character(d$name)&#xA;dstan &amp;lt;- d[ complete.cases( d$social_learning, d$research_effort , d$body , d$brain ) , ]&#xA;# prune distance matrix to spp in dstan&#xA;spp_obs &amp;lt;- dstan$name&#xA;y &amp;lt;- Primates301_distance_matrix&#xA;y2 &amp;lt;- y[ spp_obs , spp_obs ]&#xA;# scale distances&#xA;y3 &amp;lt;- y2/max(y2)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now the model, which is a non-centered L2-norm Gaussian process:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;m_GP2 &amp;lt;- ulam(&#xA;    alist(&#xA;        social_learning ~ poisson( lambda ),&#xA;        log(lambda) &amp;lt;- a + g[spp_id] + b_ef*log_research_effort + b_body*log_body + b_eq*log_brain,&#xA;        a ~ normal(0,1),&#xA;        vector[N_spp]: g &amp;lt;&amp;lt;- L_SIGMA * eta,&#xA;        vector[N_spp]: eta ~ normal( 0 , 1 ),&#xA;        matrix[N_spp,N_spp]: L_SIGMA &amp;lt;&amp;lt;- cholesky_decompose( SIGMA ),&#xA;        matrix[N_spp,N_spp]: SIGMA &amp;lt;- cov_GPL2( Dmat , etasq , rhosq , 0.01 ),&#xA;        b_body ~ normal(0,1),&#xA;        b_eq ~ normal(0,1),&#xA;        b_ef ~ normal(1,1),&#xA;        etasq ~ exponential(1),&#xA;        rhosq ~ exponential(1)&#xA;    ),&#xA;    data=list(&#xA;        N_spp = nrow(dstan),&#xA;        social_learning = dstan$social_learning,&#xA;        spp_id = 1:nrow(dstan),&#xA;        log_research_effort = log(dstan$research_effort),&#xA;        log_body = log(dstan$body),&#xA;        log_brain = log(dstan$brain),&#xA;        Dmat = y3&#xA;    ) , &#xA;    control=list(max_treedepth=15,adapt_delta=0.95) ,&#xA;    sample=FALSE )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This model does not sample quickly, so I&#39;ve set &lt;code&gt;sample=FALSE&lt;/code&gt;. You can still inspect the Stan code with &lt;code&gt;stancode(m_GP2)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that the covariance &lt;code&gt;SIGMA&lt;/code&gt; is built the same way as before, but then we immediately decompose it to a Cholesky factor and build the varying intercepts &lt;code&gt;g&lt;/code&gt; by matrix multiplication. The &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;&amp;lt;-&lt;/code&gt; operator tells &lt;code&gt;ulam&lt;/code&gt; not to loop, but to do a direct assignment. So &lt;code&gt;g &amp;lt;&amp;lt;- L_SIGMA * eta&lt;/code&gt; does the right linear algebra.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Within-chain multithreading&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;cmdstanr&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;rstan&lt;/code&gt; is currently the only way to use within-chain multithreading with &lt;code&gt;rethinking&lt;/code&gt;. It also tends to compile models faster and is more intelligent about when models need to be re-compiled, so using &lt;code&gt;cmdstanr&lt;/code&gt; is recommended, even if you don&#39;t want multithreading.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want &lt;code&gt;ulam&lt;/code&gt; to access Stan using the &lt;code&gt;cmdstanr&lt;/code&gt; package, then you may install that as well with&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;devtools::install_github(&#34;stan-dev/cmdstanr&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you haven&#39;t installed cmdstan previously, you will also need to do that with &lt;code&gt;install_cmdstan()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then you need to add &lt;code&gt;cmdstan=TRUE&lt;/code&gt; to the &lt;code&gt;ulam&lt;/code&gt; code. The &lt;code&gt;threads&lt;/code&gt; argument controls the number of threads per chain. Example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;N &amp;lt;- 1e4&#xA;x &amp;lt;- rnorm(N)&#xA;m &amp;lt;- 1 + rpois(N,2)&#xA;y &amp;lt;- rbinom( N , size=m , prob=inv_logit(-3+x) )&#xA;dat &amp;lt;- list( y=y , x=x , m=m )&#xA;# two threads&#xA;m1 &amp;lt;- ulam(&#xA;    alist(&#xA;        y ~ binomial_logit( m , logit_p ),&#xA;        logit_p &amp;lt;- a + b*x,&#xA;        a ~ normal(0,1.5),&#xA;        b ~ normal(0,0.5)&#xA;    ) , data=dat , &#xA;    cmdstan=TRUE , threads=2 , refresh=1000 )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are models that cannot be automaticaly multithreaded this way, because of the complexity of the code. In those cases, you can write the code directly in Stan. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://mc-stan.org/users/documentation/case-studies/reduce_sum_tutorial.html&#34;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt;. Writing multithreaded models direct in Stan can also be more efficient, since you can make detailed choices about which variables to pass and which pieces of the model to multithread.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Work in progress&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ulam&lt;/code&gt; is still in development, but mostly feature complete. It will remain primarily a teaching tool, exposing the statistical details of the model while hiding some of the programming details necessary in Stan.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;&lt;code&gt;map2stan&lt;/code&gt; syntax and features&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The older &lt;code&gt;map2stan&lt;/code&gt; function makes stronger assumtions about the formulas it will see. This allows is to provide some additional automation and it has some special syntax as a result. &lt;code&gt;ulam&lt;/code&gt; in contrast supports such features through its macros library.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Non-centered parameterization&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is a non-centered parameterization that moves the scale parameters in the varying effects prior to the linear model, which is often more efficient for sampling:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;f4u &amp;lt;- alist(&#xA;    y ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ),&#xA;    mu &amp;lt;- a + zaj[group]*sigma_group[1] + &#xA;         (b + zbj[group]*sigma_group[2])*x,&#xA;    c(zaj,zbj)[group] ~ dmvnorm( 0 , Rho_group ),&#xA;    a ~ dnorm( 0 , 10 ),&#xA;    b ~ dnorm( 0 , 1 ),&#xA;    sigma ~ dcauchy( 0 , 1 ),&#xA;    sigma_group ~ dcauchy( 0 , 1 ),&#xA;    Rho_group ~ dlkjcorr(2)&#xA;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Chapter 13 of the book provides a lot more detail on this issue.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We can take this strategy one step further and remove the correlation matrix, &lt;code&gt;Rho_group&lt;/code&gt;, from the prior as well. &lt;code&gt;map2stan&lt;/code&gt; facilitates this form via the &lt;code&gt;dmvnormNC&lt;/code&gt; density, which uses an internal Cholesky decomposition of the correlation matrix to build the varying effects. Here is the previous varying slopes model, now with the non-centered notation:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;f4nc &amp;lt;- alist(&#xA;    y ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ),&#xA;    mu &amp;lt;- a + aj[group] + (b + bj[group])*x,&#xA;    c(aj,bj)[group] ~ dmvnormNC( sigma_group , Rho_group ),&#xA;    a ~ dnorm( 0 , 10 ),&#xA;    b ~ dnorm( 0 , 1 ),&#xA;    sigma ~ dcauchy( 0 , 1 ),&#xA;    sigma_group ~ dcauchy( 0 , 1 ),&#xA;    Rho_group ~ dlkjcorr(2)&#xA;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Internally, a Cholesky factor &lt;code&gt;L_Rho_group&lt;/code&gt; is used to perform sampling. It will appear in the returned samples, in addition to &lt;code&gt;Rho_group&lt;/code&gt;, which is constructed from it.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Semi-automated Bayesian imputation&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is possible to code simple Bayesian imputations. For example, let&#39;s simulate a simple regression with missing predictor values:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;N &amp;lt;- 100&#xA;N_miss &amp;lt;- 10&#xA;x &amp;lt;- rnorm( N )&#xA;y &amp;lt;- rnorm( N , 2*x , 1 )&#xA;x[ sample(1:N,size=N_miss) ] &amp;lt;- NA&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;That removes 10 &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; values. Then the &lt;code&gt;map2stan&lt;/code&gt; formula list just defines a distribution for &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;f5 &amp;lt;- alist(&#xA;    y ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ),&#xA;    mu &amp;lt;- a + b*x,&#xA;    x ~ dnorm( mu_x, sigma_x ),&#xA;    a ~ dnorm( 0 , 100 ),&#xA;    b ~ dnorm( 0  , 10 ),&#xA;    mu_x ~ dnorm( 0 , 100 ),&#xA;    sigma_x ~ dcauchy(0,2),&#xA;    sigma ~ dcauchy(0,2)&#xA;)&#xA;m5 &amp;lt;- map2stan( f5 , data=list(y=y,x=x) )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;What &lt;code&gt;map2stan&lt;/code&gt; does is notice the missing values, see the distribution assigned to the variable with the missing values, build the Stan code that uses a mix of observed and estimated &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; values in the regression. See the &lt;code&gt;stancode(m5)&lt;/code&gt; for details of the implementation.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Semi-automated marginalization for binary discrete missing values&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Binary (0/1) variables with missing values present a special obstacle, because Stan cannot sample discrete parameters. So instead of imputing binary missing values, &lt;code&gt;map2stan&lt;/code&gt; can average (marginalize) over them. As in the above case, when &lt;code&gt;map2stan&lt;/code&gt; detects missing values in a predictor variable, it will try to find a distribution for the variable containing them. If this variable is binary (0/1), then it will construct a mixture model in which each term is the log-likelihood conditional on the variables taking a particular combination of 0/1 values.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Following the example in the previous section, we can simulate missingness in a binary predictor:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;N &amp;lt;- 100&#xA;N_miss &amp;lt;- 10&#xA;x &amp;lt;- rbinom( N , size=1 , prob=0.5 )&#xA;y &amp;lt;- rnorm( N , 2*x , 1 )&#xA;x[ sample(1:N,size=N_miss) ] &amp;lt;- NA&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The model definition is analogous to the previous, but also requires some care in specifying constraints for the hyperparameters that define the distribution for &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;f6 &amp;lt;- alist(&#xA;    y ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ),&#xA;    mu &amp;lt;- a + b*x,&#xA;    x ~ bernoulli( phi ),&#xA;    a ~ dnorm( 0 , 100 ),&#xA;    b ~ dnorm( 0  , 10 ),&#xA;    phi ~ beta( 1 , 1 ),&#xA;    sigma ~ dcauchy(0,2)&#xA;)&#xA;m6 &amp;lt;- map2stan( f6 , data=list(y=y,x=x) , constraints=list(phi=&#34;lower=0,upper=1&#34;) )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm works, in theory, for any number of binary predictors with missing values. For example, with two predictors, each with missingness:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;N &amp;lt;- 100&#xA;N_miss &amp;lt;- 10&#xA;x1 &amp;lt;- rbinom( N , size=1 , prob=0.5 )&#xA;x2 &amp;lt;- rbinom( N , size=1 , prob=0.1 )&#xA;y &amp;lt;- rnorm( N , 2*x1 - x2  , 1 )&#xA;x1[ sample(1:N,size=N_miss) ] &amp;lt;- NA&#xA;x2[ sample(1:N,size=N_miss) ] &amp;lt;- NA&#xA;f7 &amp;lt;- alist(&#xA;    y ~ dnorm( mu , sigma ),&#xA;    mu &amp;lt;- a + b1*x1 + b2*x2,&#xA;    x1 ~ bernoulli( phi1 ),&#xA;    x2 ~ bernoulli( phi2 ),&#xA;    a ~ dnorm( 0 , 100 ),&#xA;    c(b1,b2) ~ dnorm( 0  , 10 ),&#xA;    phi1 ~ beta( 1 , 1 ),&#xA;    phi2 ~ beta( 1 , 1 ),&#xA;    sigma ~ dcauchy(0,2)&#xA;)&#xA;m7 &amp;lt;- map2stan( f7 , data=list(y=y,x1=x1,x2=x2) , &#xA;      constraints=list(phi1=&#34;lower=0,upper=1&#34;,phi2=&#34;lower=0,upper=1&#34;) )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the unobserved values for the binary predictors are usually not of interest, they can be computed from the posterior distribution. Adding the argument &lt;code&gt;do_discrete_imputation=TRUE&lt;/code&gt; instructs &lt;code&gt;map2stan&lt;/code&gt; to perform these calculations automatically. Example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;m6 &amp;lt;- map2stan( f6 , data=list(y=y,x=x) , constraints=list(phi=&#34;lower=0,upper=1&#34;) ,&#xA;      do_discrete_imputation=TRUE )&#xA;precis( m6 , depth=2 )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The output contains samples for each case with imputed probilities that &lt;code&gt;x&lt;/code&gt; takes the value 1.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The algorithm works by constructing a list of mixture terms that are needed to to compute the probability of each observed &lt;code&gt;y&lt;/code&gt; value. In the simplest case, with only one predictor with missing values, the implied mixture likelihood contains two terms:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Pr(y[i]) = Pr(x[i]=1)Pr(y[i]|x[i]=1) + Pr(x[i]=0)Pr(y[i]|x[i]=0)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the parameters of our example model &lt;code&gt;m6&lt;/code&gt; above, this is:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Pr(y[i]) = phi*N(y[i]|a+b,sigma) + (1-phi)*N(y[i]|a,sigma)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is now a simple matter to loop over cases &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and compute the above for each. Similarly the posterior probability of that &lt;code&gt;x[i]==1&lt;/code&gt; is given as:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Pr(x[i]==1|y[i]) = phi*N(y[i]|a+b,sigma) / Pr(y[i])&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When only one predictor has missingness, then this is simple. What about when there are two or more? In that case, all the possible combinations of missingness have to be accounted for. For example, suppose there are two predictors, &lt;code&gt;x1&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x2&lt;/code&gt;, both with missingness on case &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;. Now the implied mixture likelihood is:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Pr(y[i]) = Pr(x1=1)Pr(x2=1)*Pr(y[i]|x1=1,x2=1) + Pr(x1=1)Pr(x2=0)Pr(y[i]|x1=1,x2=0) + Pr(x1=0)Pr(x2=1)Pr(y[i]|x1=0,x2=1) + Pr(x1=0)Pr(x2=0)Pr(y[i]|x1=0,x2=0)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are four combinations of unobserved values, and so four terms in the mixture likelihood. When &lt;code&gt;x2&lt;/code&gt; is instead observed, we can substitute the observed value into the above, and then the mixture simplifies readily to our previous two-term likelihood:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Pr(y[i]|x2[i]==1) = Pr(x1=1)Pr(x2=1)Pr(y[i]|x1=1,x2=1) + Pr(x1=1)Pr(x2=0)Pr(y[i]|x1=1,x2=1) + Pr(x1=0)Pr(x2=1)Pr(y[i]|x1=0,x2=1) + Pr(x1=0)Pr(x2=0)Pr(y[i]|x1=0,x2=1)&#xA;                  = [Pr(x1=1)Pr(x2=1)+Pr(x1=1)Pr(x2=0)]Pr(y[i]|x1=1,x2=1) &#xA;                    + [Pr(x1=0)Pr(x2=1)+Pr(x1=0)Pr(x2=0)]Pr(y[i]|x1=0,x2=1)&#xA;                  = Pr(x1=1)Pr(y[i]|x1=1,x2=1) + Pr(x1=0)Pr(y[i]|x1=0,x2=1)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This implies that if we loop over cases &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt; and insert any observed values into the general mixture likelihood, we can compute the relevant mixture for the specific combination of missingness on each case &lt;code&gt;i&lt;/code&gt;. That is what &lt;code&gt;map2stan&lt;/code&gt; does. The general mixture terms can be generated algorithmically. The code below generates a matrix of terms for &lt;code&gt;n&lt;/code&gt; binary variables with missingness.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;ncombinations &amp;lt;- 2^n&#xA;d &amp;lt;- matrix(NA,nrow=ncombinations,ncol=n)&#xA;for ( col_var in 1:n ) &#xA;    d[,col_var] &amp;lt;- rep( 0:1 , each=2^(col_var-1) , length.out=ncombinations )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rows of &lt;code&gt;d&lt;/code&gt; contain terms, columns contain variables, and the values in each column are the corresponding values of each variable. The algorithm builds a linear model for each row in this matrix, composes the mixture likelihood as the sum of these rows, and performs proper substitutions of observed values. All calculations are done on the log scale, for precision.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Gaussian process&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;A basic Gaussian process can be specified with the &lt;code&gt;GPL2&lt;/code&gt; distribution label. This implies a multivariate Gaussian with a covariance matrix defined by the ordinary L2 norm distance function:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;k(i,j) = eta^2 * exp( -rho^2 * D(i,j)^2 ) + ifelse(i==j,sigma^2,0)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;where &lt;code&gt;D&lt;/code&gt; is a matrix of pairwise distances. To use this convention in, for example, a spatial autocorrelation model:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(rethinking)&#xA;data(Kline2)&#xA;d &amp;lt;- Kline2&#xA;data(islandsDistMatrix)&#xA;d$society &amp;lt;- 1:10&#xA;mGP &amp;lt;- map2stan(&#xA;    alist(&#xA;        total_tools ~ dpois( mu ),&#xA;        log(mu) &amp;lt;- a + aj[society],&#xA;        a ~ dnorm(0,10),&#xA;        aj[society] ~ GPL2( Dmat , etasq , rhosq , 0.01 ),&#xA;        etasq ~ dcauchy(0,1),&#xA;        rhosq ~ dcauchy(0,1)&#xA;    ),&#xA;    data=list(&#xA;        total_tools=d$total_tools,&#xA;        society=d$society,&#xA;        Dmat=islandsDistMatrix),&#xA;    constraints=list(&#xA;        etasq=&#34;lower=0&#34;,&#xA;        rhosq=&#34;lower=0&#34;&#xA;    ),&#xA;    warmup=1000 , iter=5000 , chains=4 )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note the use of the &lt;code&gt;constraints&lt;/code&gt; list to pass custom parameter constraints to Stan. This example is explored in more detail in the book.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Information criteria&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;map2stan&lt;/code&gt; provide DIC and WAIC. Well, in most cases they do. In truth, both tools are flexible enough that you can specify models for which neither DIC nor WAIC can be correctly calculated. But for ordinary GLMs and GLMMs, it works. See the R help &lt;code&gt;?WAIC&lt;/code&gt;. A convenience function &lt;code&gt;compare&lt;/code&gt; summarizes information criteria comparisons, including standard errors for WAIC.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ulam&lt;/code&gt; supports WAIC calculation with the optional &lt;code&gt;log_lik=TRUE&lt;/code&gt; argument, which returns the kind of log-likelihood vector needed by the &lt;code&gt;loo&lt;/code&gt; package.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ensemble&lt;/code&gt; computes &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;sim&lt;/code&gt; output for an ensemble of models, each weighted by its Akaike weight, as computed from WAIC.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Code issues with 1st edition of Statistical Rethinking&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;A small change to &lt;code&gt;link&lt;/code&gt; has broken two examples in the first edition of the book, in Chapter 7.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;R code 7.10&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;mu.Africa.mean &amp;lt;- apply( mu.Africa , 2 , mean ) Error in apply(mu.Africa, 2, mean) : dim(X) must have a positive length&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This occurs because link() now returns all linear models. So mu.Africa is a list containing mu and gamma. To fix, use:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;mu.Africa.mean &amp;lt;- apply( mu.Africa$mu , 2 , mean )&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Use a similar fix in the other apply() calls in the same section.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;R code 7.17&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similar problem as for R code 7.10. Use mu.ruggedlo$mu in place of mu.ruggedlo.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

If you&#39;d like to write your own interactive content, please visit the &lt;a href=&#34;http://swirlstats.com/instructors.html&#34;&gt;Instructors page&lt;/a&gt; of our website.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here are our current offerings, organized by level of difficulty:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Beginner&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R Programming&lt;/strong&gt;: The basics of programming in R&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/swirldev/R_Programming_E&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;R Programming E&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: Same as the original, but modified slightly for in-class use (see below ***)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://swirlstats.com/scn/rpe.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The R Programming Environment&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;!-- - **Data Analysis**: Basic ideas in statistics and data visualization --&gt; &#xA;&lt;!-- - **Mathematical Biostatistics Boot Camp**: One- and two-sample t-tests, power, and sample size --&gt; &#xA;&lt;!-- - **Open Intro**: A very basic introduction to statistics, data analysis, and data visualization --&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;*** &lt;em&gt;R Programming E is identical to R Programming, except we&#39;ve eliminated the prompts for Coursera credentials at the end of each lesson and instead give students the option to send an email to their instructor notifying them of completion. Admittedly, it&#39;s sort of a hack until we come up with a more robust solution for in-class use (i.e. an instructor &#34;dashboard&#34;).&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Intermediate&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Regression Models&lt;/strong&gt;: The basics of regression modeling in R&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Getting and Cleaning Data&lt;/strong&gt;: dplyr, tidyr, lubridate, oh my!&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Advanced&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statistical Inference&lt;/strong&gt;: This intermediate to advanced level course closely follows the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/course/statinference&#34;&gt;Statistical Inference course&lt;/a&gt; of the Johns Hopkins &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.coursera.org/specialization/jhudatascience/1&#34;&gt;Data Science Specialization&lt;/a&gt; on Coursera. It introduces the student to basic concepts of statistical inference including probability, hypothesis testing, confidence intervals and p-values. It concludes with an initiation to topics of particular relevance to big data, issues of multiple testing and resampling.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://swirlstats.com/scn/arp.html&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Advanced R Programming&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since our users come from a variety backgrounds, it&#39;s very hard to label material as &lt;strong&gt;Beginner&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;Intermediate&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;Advanced&lt;/strong&gt;. If you find something that is labelled &lt;strong&gt;Beginner&lt;/strong&gt; to be challenging, please don&#39;t be discouraged. The first step of learning anything is to acknowledge that you are capable of understanding it. True understanding will come with time and practice.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Course Authors&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing swirl Courses&lt;/strong&gt;: An interactive guides and example for swirl course authors. The first group of lessons cover basics. The rest cover special topics useful primarily as samples--points of departure for one&#39;s own material. For more comprehensive documentation about writing your own swirl courses see &lt;a href=&#34;http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/&#34;&gt;http://swirlstats.com/swirlify/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Install and run a course automatically from swirl&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This is the preferred method of installing courses.&lt;/strong&gt; It automates the process by allowing you to do everything right from the R console.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Make sure you have a recent version version of swirl:&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;install.packages(&#34;swirl&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Enter the following from the R console, &lt;strong&gt;substituting the name of the course&lt;/strong&gt; that you wish to install:&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;library(swirl)&#xA;install_course(&#34;Course Name Here&#34;)&#xA;swirl()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;code&gt;install_course(&#34;R Programming&#34;)&lt;/code&gt; will install the R Programming course. &lt;strong&gt;Please note that course names are case sensitive!&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If that doesn&#39;t work for you...&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Install and run a course manually&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the automatic course installation method outlined above does not work for you, then there&#39;s a simple alternative.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Find the course you want to install on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://swirlstats.com/scn/title.html&#34;&gt;Swirl Course network website&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Follow the manual installation instructions on the course page.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If that does not work for you, consider taking a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/swirldev/swirl_courses/wiki/Legacy-Manual-Install-Instructions-for-Swirl-Courses&#34;&gt;legacy manual install instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Uninstall a course&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;d like to remove a course at any time, you can use &lt;code&gt;uninstall_course(&#34;Course Name Here&#34;)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Using swirl in the classroom&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instructors around the world are using swirl in their classrooms. We think this is awesome. If you&#39;re an instructor, please feel free to do the same -- free of charge. While your students may be paying to take your course or attend your institution, we simply ask that you don&#39;t charge people &lt;em&gt;directly&lt;/em&gt; for the use of our software or instructional content.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are not sure about a particular use case, don&#39;t hesitate to post a question to our &lt;a href=&#34;https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/swirl-discuss&#34;&gt;Google Group&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

You provide the data, tell ggplot2 how to map variables to aesthetics, what graphical primitives to use, and it takes care of the details.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;# The easiest way to get ggplot2 is to install the whole tidyverse:&#xA;install.packages(&#34;tidyverse&#34;)&#xA;&#xA;# Alternatively, install just ggplot2:&#xA;install.packages(&#34;ggplot2&#34;)&#xA;&#xA;# Or the development version from GitHub:&#xA;# install.packages(&#34;devtools&#34;)&#xA;devtools::install_github(&#34;tidyverse/ggplot2&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Cheatsheet&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/raw/master/data-visualization.pdf&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/cheatsheets/master/pngs/thumbnails/data-visualization-cheatsheet-thumbs.png&#34; width=&#34;630&#34; height=&#34;252&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;It’s hard to succinctly describe how ggplot2 works because it embodies a deep philosophy of visualisation. However, in most cases you start with &lt;code&gt;ggplot()&lt;/code&gt;, supply a dataset and aesthetic mapping (with &lt;code&gt;aes()&lt;/code&gt;). You then add on layers (like &lt;code&gt;geom_point()&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;geom_histogram()&lt;/code&gt;), scales (like &lt;code&gt;scale_colour_brewer()&lt;/code&gt;), faceting specifications (like &lt;code&gt;facet_wrap()&lt;/code&gt;) and coordinate systems (like &lt;code&gt;coord_flip()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;library(ggplot2)&#xA;&#xA;ggplot(mpg, aes(displ, hwy, colour = class)) + &#xA;  geom_point()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/tidyverse/ggplot2/main/man/figures/README-example-1.png&#34; alt=&#34;&#34;&gt;&#xA; &lt;!-- --&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Lifecycle&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://lifecycle.r-lib.org/articles/stages.html&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://img.shields.io/badge/lifecycle-stable-brightgreen.svg?sanitize=true&#34; alt=&#34;lifecycle&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;ggplot2 is now over 10 years old and is used by hundreds of thousands of people to make millions of plots. That means, by-and-large, ggplot2 itself changes relatively little. When we do make changes, they will be generally to add new functions or arguments rather than changing the behaviour of existing functions, and if we do make changes to existing behaviour we will do them for compelling reasons.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are looking for innovation, look to ggplot2’s rich ecosystem of extensions. See a community maintained list at &lt;a href=&#34;https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/&#34;&gt;https://exts.ggplot2.tidyverse.org/gallery/&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Learning ggplot2&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are new to ggplot2 you are better off starting with a systematic introduction, rather than trying to learn from reading individual documentation pages. Currently, there are three good places to start:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://r4ds.had.co.nz/data-visualisation.html&#34;&gt;Data Visualisation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://r4ds.had.co.nz/graphics-for-communication.html&#34;&gt;Graphics for communication&lt;/a&gt; chapters in &lt;a href=&#34;https://r4ds.had.co.nz&#34;&gt;R for Data Science&lt;/a&gt;. R for Data Science is designed to give you a comprehensive introduction to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.tidyverse.org&#34;&gt;tidyverse&lt;/a&gt;, and these two chapters will get you up to speed with the essentials of ggplot2 as quickly as possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’d like to take an online course, try &lt;a href=&#34;https://learning.oreilly.com/videos/data-visualization-in/9781491963661/&#34;&gt;Data Visualization in R With ggplot2&lt;/a&gt; by Kara Woo.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you’d like to follow a webinar, try &lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/h29g21z0a68&#34;&gt;Plotting Anything with ggplot2&lt;/a&gt; by Thomas Lin Pedersen.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you want to dive into making common graphics as quickly as possible, I recommend &lt;a href=&#34;https://r-graphics.org&#34;&gt;The R Graphics Cookbook&lt;/a&gt; by Winston Chang. It provides a set of recipes to solve common graphics problems.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you’ve mastered the basics and want to learn more, read &lt;a href=&#34;https://ggplot2-book.org&#34;&gt;ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis&lt;/a&gt;. It describes the theoretical underpinnings of ggplot2 and shows you how all the pieces fit together. This book helps you understand the theory that underpins ggplot2, and will help you create new types of graphics specifically tailored to your needs.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Getting help&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are two main places to get help with ggplot2:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://community.rstudio.com/&#34;&gt;RStudio community&lt;/a&gt; is a friendly place to ask any questions about ggplot2.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ggplot2?sort=frequent&amp;amp;pageSize=50&#34;&gt;Stack Overflow&lt;/a&gt; is a great source of answers to common ggplot2 questions. It is also a great place to get help, once you have created a reproducible example that illustrates your problem.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt;</summary>

It provides flexible ways to input spectral data from a variety of equipment manufacturers, process these data, extract variables, and produce publication-quality figures.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;pavo&lt;/code&gt; was written with the following workflow in mind:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Organise&lt;/strong&gt; data by importing and processing spectra and images (e.g., to remove noise, negative values, smooth curves, etc.).&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Analyse&lt;/strong&gt; the resulting files, using spectral analyses of shape (hue, saturation, brightness), visual models based on perceptual data, and/or spatial adjacency and boundary strength analyses.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Visualise&lt;/strong&gt; the output, with multiple options provided for exploration, presentation, and analysis.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Need more information, or help with the package?&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Take a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://book.colrverse.com&#34;&gt;package documentation&lt;/a&gt; for detailed examples and discussion.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Check out the &lt;a href=&#34;http://pavo.colrverse.com/news/index.html&#34;&gt;latest news&lt;/a&gt; for changes and updates.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Need help or advice and can&#39;t find what you&#39;re looking for?&lt;/strong&gt; Head over to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/colrverse/colRverse/discussions&#34;&gt;colRverse discussion board&lt;/a&gt; and feel free to post a message.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If all else fails&lt;/strong&gt; (or you don&#39;t have a GitHub account), &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:thomas.white@sydney.edu.au&#34;&gt;email Tom&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Citing pavo&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The manuscript describing the current iteration of the package has been published and is free to access:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maia R., Gruson H., Endler J.A., and White T.E. 2019 &lt;a href=&#34;https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13174&#34;&gt;pavo 2: New tools for the spectral and spatial analysis of colour in R&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;Methods in Ecology and Evolution&lt;/em&gt;, 10(7):1097‑1107.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Install&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the development page for &lt;code&gt;pavo&lt;/code&gt;.

If you don&#39;t specify a path, devtools will look in the current working directory - this is a recommended practice.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Frequent development tasks:&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;load_all()&lt;/code&gt; simulates installing and reloading your package, loading R code in &lt;code&gt;R/&lt;/code&gt;, compiled shared objects in &lt;code&gt;src/&lt;/code&gt; and data files in &lt;code&gt;data/&lt;/code&gt;. During development you would usually want to access all functions (even un-exported internal ones) so &lt;code&gt;load_all()&lt;/code&gt; works as if all functions were exported in the package &lt;code&gt;NAMESPACE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;document()&lt;/code&gt; updates generated documentation in &lt;code&gt;man/&lt;/code&gt;, file collation and &lt;code&gt;NAMESPACE&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt; reloads your code with &lt;code&gt;load_all()&lt;/code&gt;, then runs all &lt;code&gt;testthat&lt;/code&gt; tests.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;test_coverage()&lt;/code&gt; runs test coverage on your package with &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/r-lib/covr&#34;&gt;covr&lt;/a&gt;. This makes it easy to see what parts of your package could use more tests!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Building and installing:&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;install()&lt;/code&gt; reinstalls the package, detaches the currently loaded version then reloads the new version with &lt;code&gt;library()&lt;/code&gt;. Reloading a package is not guaranteed to work: see the documentation for &lt;code&gt;unload()&lt;/code&gt; for caveats.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;build()&lt;/code&gt; builds a package file from package sources. You can use it to build a binary version of your package.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;install_*&lt;/code&gt; functions install an R package:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;install_github()&lt;/code&gt; from GitHub&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;install_gitlab()&lt;/code&gt; from GitLab&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;install_bitbucket()&lt;/code&gt; from Bitbucket&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;install_url()&lt;/code&gt; from an arbitrary url&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;install_git()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;install_svn()&lt;/code&gt; from an arbitrary git or SVN repository&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;install_local()&lt;/code&gt; from a local file on disk&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;install_version()&lt;/code&gt; from a specific version on CRAN&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;update_packages()&lt;/code&gt; updates a package to the latest version. This works both on packages installed from CRAN as well as those installed from any of the &lt;code&gt;install_*&lt;/code&gt; functions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Check and release:&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;check()&lt;/code&gt; updates the documentation, then builds and checks the package locally. &lt;code&gt;check_win()&lt;/code&gt; checks a package using &lt;a href=&#34;https://win-builder.r-project.org/&#34;&gt;win-builder&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;check_rhub()&lt;/code&gt; checks a package using &lt;a href=&#34;https://log.r-hub.io/&#34;&gt;r-hub&lt;/a&gt;. This allows you to easily check your package on all systems CRAN uses before submission.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;release()&lt;/code&gt; makes sure everything is ok with your package (including asking you a number of questions), then builds and uploads to CRAN.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Learning more&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;R package development can be intimidating, however there are now a number of valuable resources to help!&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://r-pkgs.org&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;http://r-pkgs.org/images/cover.png&#34; height=&#34;252&#34; align=&#34;right&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;R Packages is a book that gives a comprehensive treatment of all common parts of package development and uses devtools throughout.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;The first edition is available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://r-pkgs.org/&#34;&gt;https://r-pkgs.org/&lt;/a&gt;, but note that it has grown somewhat out of sync with the current version of devtools.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;A second edition is under development and is evolving to reflect the current state of devtools. It is available at &lt;a href=&#34;https://r-pkgs.org&#34;&gt;https://r-pkgs.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://r-pkgs.org/whole-game.html&#34;&gt;Whole Game&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://r-pkgs.org/package-structure-state.html&#34;&gt;Package structure&lt;/a&gt; chapters make great places to start.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://community.rstudio.com/c/package-development/11&#34;&gt;RStudio community - package development&lt;/a&gt; is a great place to ask specific questions related to package development.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://devguide.ropensci.org/&#34;&gt;rOpenSci packages&lt;/a&gt; has extensive documentation on best practices for R packages looking to be contributed to rOpenSci, but also very useful general recommendations for package authors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;There are a number of fantastic blog posts on writing your first package, including&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hilaryparker.com/2014/04/29/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/&#34;&gt;Writing an R package from scratch - Hilary Parker&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://masalmon.eu/2017/12/11/goodrpackages/&#34;&gt;How to develop good R packages - Maëlle Salmon&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://tinyheero.github.io/jekyll/update/2015/07/26/making-your-first-R-package.html&#34;&gt;Making your first R package - Fong Chun Chan&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://r-mageddon.netlify.app/post/writing-an-r-package-from-scratch/&#34;&gt;Writing an R package from scratch - Tomas Westlake&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html&#34;&gt;Writing R Extensions&lt;/a&gt; is the exhaustive, canonical reference for writing R packages, maintained by the R core developers.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Conscious uncoupling&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;devtools started off as a lean-and-mean package to facilitate local package development, but over the years it accumulated more and more functionality. devtools has undergone a &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.archive.org/web/20140326060230/https://www.goop.com/journal/be/conscious-uncoupling&#34;&gt;conscious uncoupling&lt;/a&gt; to split out functionality into smaller, more tightly focussed packages. This includes:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/r-lib/testthat&#34;&gt;testthat&lt;/a&gt;: Writing and running tests (i.e. &lt;code&gt;test()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/r-lib/roxygen2&#34;&gt;roxygen2&lt;/a&gt;: Function and package documentation (i.e. &lt;code&gt;document()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/r-lib/remotes&#34;&gt;remotes&lt;/a&gt;: Installing packages (i.e. &lt;code&gt;install_github()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/r-lib/pkgbuild&#34;&gt;pkgbuild&lt;/a&gt;: Building binary packages (including checking if build tools are available) (i.e. &lt;code&gt;build()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/r-lib/pkgload&#34;&gt;pkgload&lt;/a&gt;: Simulating package loading (i.e. &lt;code&gt;load_all()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/r-lib/rcmdcheck&#34;&gt;rcmdcheck&lt;/a&gt;: Running R CMD check and reporting the results (i.e. &lt;code&gt;check()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/r-lib/revdepcheck&#34;&gt;revdepcheck&lt;/a&gt;: Running R CMD check on all reverse dependencies, and figuring out what&#39;s changed since the last CRAN release (i.e. &lt;code&gt;revdep_check()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/r-lib/sessioninfo&#34;&gt;sessioninfo&lt;/a&gt;: R session info (i.e. &lt;code&gt;session_info()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/r-lib/usethis&#34;&gt;usethis&lt;/a&gt;: Automating package setup (i.e. &lt;code&gt;use_test()&lt;/code&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally, you would not need to worry about these different packages, because devtools installs all of them automatically. You will need to care, however, if you&#39;re filing a bug because reporting it at the correct place will lead to a speedier resolution.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may also need to care if you are trying to use some devtools functionality in your own package or deployed application. Generally in these cases it is better to depend on the particular package directly rather than depend on devtools, e.g. use &lt;code&gt;sessioninfo::session_info()&lt;/code&gt; rather than &lt;code&gt;devtools::session_info()&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;remotes::install_github()&lt;/code&gt; vs &lt;code&gt;devtools::install_github()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;However for day to day development we recommend you continue to use &lt;code&gt;library(devtools)&lt;/code&gt; to quickly load all needed development tools, just like &lt;code&gt;library(tidyverse)&lt;/code&gt; quickly loads all the tools necessary for data exploration and visualization.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Code of conduct&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please note that the devtools project is released with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/r-lib/devtools/raw/main/.github/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md&#34;&gt;Contributor Code of Conduct&lt;/a&gt;.

For the version history and detailed important changes, please see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sqjin/CellChat/raw/master/NEWS.md&#34;&gt;NEWS file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Capabilities&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to infer the intercellular communication from any given scRNA-seq data, CellChat provides functionality for further data exploration, analysis, and visualization.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;It is able to analyze cell-cell communication for continuous states along cellular development trajectories.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;It can quantitatively characterize and compare the inferred cell-cell communication networks using an integrated approach by combining social network analysis, pattern recognition, and manifold learning approaches.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;It provides an easy-to-use tool for extracting and visualizing high-order information of the inferred networks. For example, it allows ready prediction of major signaling inputs and outputs for all cell populations and how these populations and signals coordinate together for functions.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;It provides several visualization outputs to facilitate intuitive user-guided data interpretation.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Check out &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-21246-9&#34;&gt;our paper (Jin et al., Nature Communications, 2021)&lt;/a&gt; for the detailed methods and applications.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;CellChat R package can be easily installed from Github using devtools:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;devtools::install_github(&#34;sqjin/CellChat&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Please make sure you have installed the correct version of &lt;code&gt;NMF&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;circlize&lt;/code&gt; package&lt;/strong&gt;.

This relieves the developers from addressing the same issues and helps them focus on adding new features!&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;The best way to figure out the issues is &lt;strong&gt;running the sources codes&lt;/strong&gt; of the specific functions by yourself. This will also relieve the developers and helps them focus on the common issues!

The &lt;strong&gt;gt&lt;/strong&gt; philosophy: we can construct a wide variety of useful tables with a cohesive set of table parts. These include the &lt;em&gt;table header&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;stub&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;column labels&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;spanner column labels&lt;/em&gt;, the &lt;em&gt;table body&lt;/em&gt;, and the &lt;em&gt;table footer&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;div align=&#34;center&#34;&gt; &#xA; &lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/gt/master/man/figures/gt_parts_of_a_table.svg?sanitize=true&#34; width=&#34;800px&#34;&gt; &#xA;&lt;/div&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;It all begins with &lt;strong&gt;table data&lt;/strong&gt; (be it a tibble or a data frame). You then decide how to compose your &lt;strong&gt;gt table&lt;/strong&gt; with the elements and formatting you need for the task at hand. Finally, the table is rendered by printing it at the console, including it in an R Markdown document, or exporting to a file using &lt;code&gt;gtsave()&lt;/code&gt;. Currently, &lt;strong&gt;gt&lt;/strong&gt; supports the &lt;strong&gt;HTML&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;LaTeX&lt;/strong&gt;, and &lt;strong&gt;RTF&lt;/strong&gt; output formats.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;div align=&#34;center&#34;&gt; &#xA; &lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/gt/master/man/figures/gt_workflow_diagram.svg?sanitize=true&#34; width=&#34;800px&#34;&gt; &#xA;&lt;/div&gt; &#xA;&lt;hr&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;gt&lt;/strong&gt; package is designed to be both straightforward yet powerful. The emphasis is on simple functions for the everyday display table needs. Here is a brief example of how to use &lt;strong&gt;gt&lt;/strong&gt; to create a table from the included &lt;code&gt;sp500&lt;/code&gt; dataset:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;library(gt)&#xA;library(tidyverse)&#xA;library(glue)&#xA;&#xA;# Define the start and end dates for the data range&#xA;start_date &amp;lt;- &#34;2010-06-07&#34;&#xA;end_date &amp;lt;- &#34;2010-06-14&#34;&#xA;&#xA;# Create a gt table based on preprocessed&#xA;# `sp500` table data&#xA;sp500 %&amp;gt;%&#xA;  filter(date &amp;gt;= start_date &amp;amp; date &amp;lt;= end_date) %&amp;gt;%&#xA;  select(-adj_close) %&amp;gt;%&#xA;  gt() %&amp;gt;%&#xA;  tab_header(&#xA;    title = &#34;S&amp;amp;P 500&#34;,&#xA;    subtitle = glue(&#34;{start_date} to {end_date}&#34;)&#xA;  ) %&amp;gt;%&#xA;  fmt_date(&#xA;    columns = date,&#xA;    date_style = 3&#xA;  ) %&amp;gt;%&#xA;  fmt_currency(&#xA;    columns = c(open, high, low, close),&#xA;    currency = &#34;USD&#34;&#xA;  ) %&amp;gt;%&#xA;  fmt_number(&#xA;    columns = volume,&#xA;    suffixing = TRUE&#xA;  )&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;div align=&#34;center&#34;&gt; &#xA; &lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rstudio/gt/master/man/figures/gt_sp500_table.svg?sanitize=true&#34; width=&#34;800px&#34;&gt; &#xA;&lt;/div&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are six datasets included in &lt;strong&gt;gt&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;countrypops&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sza&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;gtcars&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;sp500&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;pizzaplace&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;exibble&lt;/code&gt;. All of them are useful for experimenting with &lt;strong&gt;gt&lt;/strong&gt;’s functions.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Beyond this simple example, there are many functions available in &lt;strong&gt;gt&lt;/strong&gt; for creating super-customized tables. For much more information on these, visit the &lt;a href=&#34;https://gt.rstudio.com/&#34;&gt;documentation website&lt;/a&gt; or take a &lt;em&gt;Test Drive&lt;/em&gt; in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.cloud/project/779965&#34;&gt;RStudio Cloud project&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;DISCUSSIONS&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s talk about making tables with &lt;strong&gt;gt&lt;/strong&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/gt/discussions&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Discussions&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;! It&#39;s a great place to ask questions about how to use the package, discuss some ideas, engage with others, and much more!&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;INSTALLATION&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;gt&lt;/strong&gt; package can be installed from &lt;strong&gt;CRAN&lt;/strong&gt; with:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;install.packages(&#34;gt&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also choose to install the development version of &lt;strong&gt;gt&lt;/strong&gt; from &lt;strong&gt;GitHub&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;devtools::install_github(&#34;rstudio/gt&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you encounter a bug, have usage questions, or want to share ideas to make this package better, please feel free to file an &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/gt/issues&#34;&gt;issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;hr&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;How &lt;strong&gt;gt&lt;/strong&gt; fits in with Other Packages that Generate Display Tables&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;gt&lt;/strong&gt; package joins a burgeoning collection of packages for display table generation. Why another? We feel that there is enough room in this space to innovate further. Here are some of the ways that &lt;strong&gt;gt&lt;/strong&gt; contributes to this ecosystem:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;the interface is high-level and declarative (general instructions versus very specific)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;the formatting options are ‘batteries included’ (scientific notation, uncertainty, ranges, percentages, suffixes, localized currency, dates/times + much more)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;there is excellent, pain-free support for footnotes&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;the output is ‘camera-ready’&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;multiple output formats are supported with the same declarative interface&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;the API closely follows tidyverse conventions by adhering to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://style.tidyverse.org&#34;&gt;tidyverse style guide&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;there’s a focus on making the package documentation and examples the best they can be&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;rigorous QA/QC measures: high test coverage for automated tests, and thorough manual testing by QA engineers (with every proposed code change)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;While &lt;strong&gt;gt&lt;/strong&gt; is trying to do something different with its own interface, it may not suit your specific needs. Here is a listing of other leading table-making &lt;strong&gt;R&lt;/strong&gt; packages, with links to their respective project pages:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;knitr&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/yihui/knitr&#34;&gt;GITHUB&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://yihui.org/knitr/&#34;&gt;WEBSITE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;kableExtra&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/haozhu233/kableExtra&#34;&gt;GITHUB&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://haozhu233.github.io/kableExtra/&#34;&gt;WEBSITE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;formattable&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/renkun-ken/formattable&#34;&gt;GITHUB&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://renkun-ken.github.io/formattable/&#34;&gt;WEBSITE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DT&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/rstudio/DT&#34;&gt;GITHUB&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://rstudio.github.io/DT/&#34;&gt;WEBSITE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pander&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Rapporter/pander&#34;&gt;GITHUB&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;http://rapporter.github.io/pander/&#34;&gt;WEBSITE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;huxtable&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/hughjonesd/huxtable&#34;&gt;GITHUB&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://hughjonesd.github.io/huxtable/&#34;&gt;WEBSITE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;reactable&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/glin/reactable&#34;&gt;GITHUB&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://glin.github.io/reactable/&#34;&gt;WEBSITE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;flextable&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/davidgohel/flextable&#34;&gt;GITHUB&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://davidgohel.github.io/flextable/&#34;&gt;WEBSITE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ftextra&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/atusy/ftExtra&#34;&gt;GITHUB&lt;/a&gt;,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a href=&#34;https://ftextra.atusy.net/&#34;&gt;WEBSITE&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;pixiedust&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nutterb/pixiedust&#34;&gt;GITHUB&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;tangram&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/spgarbet/tangram&#34;&gt;GITHUB&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ztable&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cardiomoon/ztable&#34;&gt;GITHUB&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;condformat&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/zeehio/condformat&#34;&gt;GITHUB&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;stargazer&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=stargazer&#34;&gt;CRAN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;xtable&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp;(&lt;a href=&#34;https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=xtable&#34;&gt;CRAN&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Code of Conduct&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please note that the gt project is released with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/0/code_of_conduct/&#34;&gt;contributor code of conduct&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt;By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;📄 License&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;gt&lt;/strong&gt; is licensed under the MIT license.

As well as these single-table verbs, dplyr also provides a variety of two-table verbs, which you can learn about in &lt;code&gt;vignette(&#34;two-table&#34;)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you are new to dplyr, the best place to start is the &lt;a href=&#34;https://r4ds.had.co.nz/transform.html&#34;&gt;data transformation chapter&lt;/a&gt; in R for data science.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Backends&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to data frames/tibbles, dplyr makes working with other computational backends accessible and efficient. Below is a list of alternative backends:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dtplyr.tidyverse.org/&#34;&gt;dtplyr&lt;/a&gt;: for large, in-memory datasets. Translates your dplyr code to high performance &lt;a href=&#34;https://rdatatable.gitlab.io/data.table/&#34;&gt;data.table&lt;/a&gt; code.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://dbplyr.tidyverse.org/&#34;&gt;dbplyr&lt;/a&gt;: for data stored in a relational database. Translates your dplyr code to SQL.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://spark.rstudio.com&#34;&gt;sparklyr&lt;/a&gt;: for very large datasets stored in &lt;a href=&#34;https://spark.apache.org&#34;&gt;Apache Spark&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;# The easiest way to get dplyr is to install the whole tidyverse:&#xA;install.packages(&#34;tidyverse&#34;)&#xA;&#xA;# Alternatively, install just dplyr:&#xA;install.packages(&#34;dplyr&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

It demonstrated a significantly increased risk of major ischemic or hemorrhagic events associated with treatment of rivaroxaban compared to that of apixaban. This study aims to independently replicate that study using a similar database. It also aims to evaluate the robustness of the study findings by conducting sensitivity analyses, assessing: 1) changes to definitions of exposure and outcome phenotypes, 2) calibration of effect estimates using empirical null distributions, and 3) observable study diagnostics that inform the validity of a given analysis. Finally, it aims to explore the generalizability of the findings by executing the analysis on alternative databases with varying populations (U.S. and non-U.S.) and mechanisms of data capture (electronic health records data).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Requirements&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;A database in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/OHDSI/CommonDataModel&#34;&gt;Common Data Model version 5&lt;/a&gt; in one of these platforms: SQL Server, Oracle, PostgreSQL, IBM Netezza, Apache Impala, Amazon RedShift, Google BigQuery, or Microsoft APS.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;R version 4.0.0 or newer&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;On Windows: &lt;a href=&#34;http://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/Rtools/&#34;&gt;RTools&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://java.com&#34;&gt;Java&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/&#34;&gt;RStudio&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;How to Run&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://ohdsi.github.io/Hades/rSetup.html&#34;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt; for setting up your R environment, including RTools and Java.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Create an Rstudio project:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;In Rstudio, click on File &amp;gt; New Project&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;New window asks to select the type of project; select Version COntrol &amp;gt; Git&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Clone an existing repository: &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;In the textbox Repository URL place: &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/ReproducibilityRayJAMA2021.git&#34;&gt;https://github.com/ohdsi-studies/ReproducibilityRayJAMA2021.git&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;This will fill in a project directory name of: ReproducibilityRayJAMA2021&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;Identify directory where you want this project&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;The project will be cloned into the folder&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Set up &lt;code&gt;renv&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;If not already installed, run &lt;code&gt;install.packages(&#34;renv&#34;)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;renv::restore()&lt;/code&gt; in the R console.

Please consult the DESCRIPTION file for more details on required R packages. Harmony has been tested on Linux, OS X, and Windows platforms.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Installation&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To run Harmony, open R and install harmony from CRAN:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;install.packages(&#34;harmony&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you&#39;d like the latest development version, install from this github directly:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;library(devtools)&#xA;install_github(&#34;immunogenomics/harmony&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Usage/Demos&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We made it easy to run Harmony in most common R analysis pipelines.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Quick Start&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Check out this &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony/raw/master/vignettes/quickstart.Rmd&#34;&gt;vignette&lt;/a&gt; for a quick start tutorial.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;PCA matrix&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Harmony algorithm iteratively corrects PCA embeddings. To input your own low dimensional embeddings directly, set &lt;code&gt;do_pca=FALSE&lt;/code&gt;. Harmony is packaged with a small dataset&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;library(harmony)&#xA;my_harmony_embeddings &amp;lt;- HarmonyMatrix(my_pca_embeddings, meta_data, &#34;dataset&#34;, do_pca=FALSE)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Normalized gene matrix&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also run Harmony on a sparse matrix of library size normalized expression counts. Harmony will scale these counts, run PCA, and finally perform integration.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;library(harmony)&#xA;my_harmony_embeddings &amp;lt;- HarmonyMatrix(normalized_counts, meta_data, &#34;dataset&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Seurat&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can run Harmony within your Seurat workflow. You&#39;ll only need to make two changes to your code.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Run Harmony with the &lt;code&gt;RunHarmony()&lt;/code&gt; function&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;In downstream analyses, use the Harmony embeddings instead of PCA.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, run Harmony and then UMAP in two lines.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;seuratObj &amp;lt;- RunHarmony(seuratObj, &#34;dataset&#34;)&#xA;seuratObj &amp;lt;- RunUMAP(seuratObj, reduction = &#34;harmony&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For details, check out these vignettes:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony/raw/master/docs/SeuratV2.html&#34;&gt;Seurat V2&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony/raw/master/docs/SeuratV3.html&#34;&gt;Seurat V3&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;MUDAN&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can run Harmony with functions from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/jefworks/mudan&#34;&gt;MUDAN package&lt;/a&gt;. For more, details, check out this &lt;a href=&#34;http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony/raw/master/docs/mudan.html&#34;&gt;vignette&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Harmony with two or more covariates&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Harmony can integrate over multiple covariates. To do this, specify a vector covariates to integrate.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;my_harmony_embeddings &amp;lt;- HarmonyMatrix(&#xA;  my_pca_embeddings, meta_data, c(&#34;dataset&#34;, &#34;donor&#34;, &#34;batch_id&#34;),&#xA;  do_pca = FALSE&#xA;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Do the same with your Seurat object:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-r&#34;&gt;seuratObject &amp;lt;- RunHarmony(seuratObject, c(&#34;dataset&#34;, &#34;donor&#34;, &#34;batch_id&#34;))&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Advanced&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The examples above all return integrated PCA embeddings. We created a more &lt;a href=&#34;http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/immunogenomics/harmony/raw/master/docs/advanced.html&#34;&gt;advanced tutorial&lt;/a&gt; that explores the internal data structures used in the Harmony algorithm.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Reproducing results from manuscript&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Code to reproduce Harmony results from the Korsunsky et al 2019 manuscript will be made available on github.com/immunogenomics/harmony2019.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
