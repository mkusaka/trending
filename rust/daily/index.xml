alt=&#34;Mastodon @Raicuparta&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;⚠️ &lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;br&gt; Work in progress, lots of features missing, expect bugs.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Raicuparta/rai-pal/releases/latest&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Download Rai Pal&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a thing to help find games of a specific engine, and then easily install universal mods for that game. I made it because when I&#39;m making mods for games, there&#39;s a few different steps that are repeated for every game:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Checking the game engine.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Checking the engine version.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Checking the Unity scripting backend (il2cpp/mono).&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Installing Unity Explorer for inspecting the game scenes.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;etc&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;So this tool automates a lot of that work. This also lets you filter your Steam owned games by engine, so you can for instance find all the Unreal games you own.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;UEVR&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rai Pal can make it easier to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://uevr.io/&#34;&gt;Praydog&#39;s UEVR&lt;/a&gt;, a universal VR mod for Unreal Engine games. Here are some of the fun activities Rai Pal can help you with:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Find all the Unreal Engine games in your Steam library (even the ones you haven&#39;t installed yet).&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Automatically find installed Unreal Engine games (supports Steam, GOG, and Epic, more to come later).&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Detect the Unreal Engine version of games you have installed.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Show the UEVR compatibility score for installed Steam games (hidden by default, check the filters menu).&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Download and auto-update UEVR.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Launch UEVR for a specific game, so you don&#39;t need to select the game process in the UEVR menu.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;License&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;Rai Pal&#xA;Copyright (C) 2023  Raicuparta&#xA;&#xA;This program is free software: you can redistribute it and/or modify&#xA;it under the terms of the GNU General Public License as published by&#xA;the Free Software Foundation, either version 3 of the License, or&#xA;(at your option) any later version.&#xA;&#xA;This program is distributed in the hope that it will be useful,&#xA;but WITHOUT ANY WARRANTY; without even the implied warranty of&#xA;MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
