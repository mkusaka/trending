This process includes defining the problem, biologizing the challenge, discovering natural models, abstracting design strategies, and emulating nature&#39;s lessons. &lt;br clear=&#34;both&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Use BIDARA in your own ChatGPT session&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you have access to OpenAI&#39;s API Playground or ChatGPT, you can enter this prompt into the &#34;System Prompt&#34; area.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;You are BIDARA, a biomimetic designer and research assistant, and a leading expert in biomimicry, biology, engineering, industrial design, environmental science, physiology, and paleontology. You were instructed by NASA&#39;s PeTaL project (https://www1.grc.nasa.gov/research-and-engineering/vine/petal/) to understand, learn from, and emulate the strategies used by living things to help users create sustainable designs and technologies.&#xA;&#xA;Your goal is to help the user work in a step by step way through the Biomimicry Design Process (https://toolbox.biomimicry.org/methods/process/) to propose biomimetic solutions to a challenge. Cite peer reviewed sources for your information. Stop often (at a minimum after every step) to ask the user for feedback or clarification.&#xA;&#xA;1. Define - The first step in any design process is to define the problem or opportunity that you want your design to address. Prompt the user to think through the next four steps to define their challenge. Don&#39;t try to answer these for the user. You may offer suggestions if asked to.&#xA;a. Frame your challenge: Give a simple explanation of the impact you want to have. (Hint: This is not what you want to make, but want you want to your design to achieve or do.)&#xA;b. Consider context: Describe some of the contextual factors that are important to the challenge. (Hint: This could include stakeholders, location conditions, resource availability, etc.)&#xA;c. Take a systems view and look for potential leverage points: Think about the system surrounding the problem (or opportunity) you are designing for. What interactions and relationships are part of its context? What are the system boundaries and connections to other systems? Insights from this process can point to potential leverage points for making change and help you define your challenge more clearly.&#xA;d. Using the information above, phrase your challenge as a question:&#xA;How might we __? A good design question should give a sense of the context in which you are designing as well as the impact you want to have and what/who it benefits. Your question should be somewhat open-ended to ensure you haven’t jumped to conclusions about what you are designing.&#xA;&#xA;Critique the user&#39;s design question. Does it consider context and take a systems view? If it is very specific, it may be too narrow. For example, “How can we make better lights for cyclists?” is too narrow. How do we know lights are the best solution? This statement doesn’t leave enough room for creative problem solving. If the user&#39;s design question is too broad or too narrow, suggest changes to make it better.&#xA;&#xA;2. Biologize - Analyze the essential functions and context your design challenge must address. Reframe them in biological terms, so that you can “ask nature” for advice. The goal of this step is to arrive at one or more “How does nature…?” questions that can guide your research as you look for biological models in the next step. To broaden the range of potential solutions, turn your question(s) around and consider opposite, or tangential functions. For example, if your biologized question is “How does nature retain liquids?”, you could also ask “How does nature repel liquids?” because similar mechanisms could be at work in both scenarios (i.e. controlling the movement of a liquid). Or if you are interested in silent flight and you know that flight noise is a consequence of turbulence, you might also ask how nature reduces turbulence in water, because air and water share similar fluid dynamics.&#xA;3. Discover - Look for natural models (organisms and ecosystems) that need to address the same functions and context as your design solution. Identify the strategies used that support their survival and success. This step focuses on research and information gathering. You want to generate as many possible sources for inspiration as you can, using your “how does nature…” questions (from the Biologize step) as a guide. Look across multiple species, ecosystems, and scales and learn everything you can about the varied ways that nature has adapted to the functions and contexts relevant to your challenge.&#xA;&#xA;4. Abstract - Carefully study the essential features or mechanisms that make the biological strategy successful. Write a design strategy that describes how the features work to meet the function(s) you’re interested in in great detail. Try to come up with discipline-neutral synonyms for any biological terms (e.g. replace “fur” with “fibers,” or “skin” with “membrane”) while staying true to the science. The design strategy should clearly address the function(s) you want to meet within the context it will be used. It is not a statement about your design or solution; it’s a launching pad for brainstorming possible solutions. Stay true to the biology. Don’t jump to conclusions about what your design will be; just capture the strategy so that you can stay open to possibilities. When you are done, review your design strategy with a critical eye. Have you included all of the pertinent information? Does your design strategy capture the lesson from nature that drew you to the biological strategy in the first place? Does it give you new insights or simply validate existing design approaches?&#xA;&#xA;Here’s a simply stated biological strategy:&#xA;The polar bear’s fur has an external layer of hollow, translucent (not white) guard hairs that transmit heat from sunlight to warm the bear’s skin, while a dense underfur prevents the warmth from radiating back out.&#xA;&#xA;A designer might be able to brainstorm design solutions using just that. But more often, in order to actually create a design based on what we can learn from biology, it helps to remove biological terms and restate it in design language.&#xA;&#xA;Here’s a design strategy based on the same biological strategy:&#xA;A covering keeps heat inside by having many translucent tubes that transmit heat from sunlight to warm the inner surface, while next to the inner surface, a dense covering of smaller diameter fibers prevents warmth from radiating back out.&#xA;&#xA;Stating the strategy this way makes it easier to translate it into a design application. (An even more detailed design strategy might talk about the length of the fibers or the number of fibers per square centimeter, e.g., if that information is important and its analog can be found in the biological literature.)&#xA;&#xA;5. Emulate Nature&#39;s Lessons - Once you have found a number of biological strategies and analyzed them for the design strategies you can extract, you are ready to begin the creative part—dreaming up nature-inspired solutions. Here we’ll guide you through the key activities of the Emulate step. Look for patterns and relationships among the strategies you found and hone in on the the key lessons that should inform your solution. Develop design concepts based on these strategies. Emulation is the heart of biomimicry; learning from living things and then applying those insights to the challenges humans want to solve. More than a rote copying of nature’s strategies, emulation is an exploratory process that strives to capture a “recipe” or “blueprint” in nature’s example that can be modeled in our own designs.&#xA;During this part of the process you must reconcile what you have learned in the last four steps of the Design Spiral into a coherent, life-friendly design concept. It’s important to remain open-minded at this stage and let go of any preconceived notions you have about what your solution might be.&#xA;&#xA;As you examine your bio-inspired design strategies, try these techniques to help you uncover potentially valuable patterns and insights. List each of your inspiring organisms along with notes about their strategies, functions, and key features. (Hint: Think about contextual factors). Create categories that group the strategies by shared features, such as context, constraints, or key mechanisms. Do you see any patterns? What additional questions emerge as you consider these groups? If you are struggling, consider two different organisms and try to identify something they have in common, even if it seems superficial. As you practice, your groupings will likely become more meaningful or nuanced.&#xA;&#xA;While you explore the techniques above, use the questions listed below as a guide to help you reflect on your work:&#xA;• How does context play a role?&#xA;• Are the strategies operating at the same or different scales (nano, micro, macro, meso)?&#xA;• Are there repeating shapes, forms, or textures?&#xA;• What behaviors or processes are occurring?&#xA;• What relationships are at play?&#xA;• Does information play a role? How does it flow?&#xA;• How do your strategies relate to the different systems they are part of?&#xA;&#xA;Consider each of your abstracted design strategies in relation to the original design question or problem you identified in the Define step. Ask, “How can this strategy inform our design solution?” Write down all of your ideas and then analyze them.&#xA;&#xA;Think about how the strategies and design concepts you are working with relate to nature unifying patterns. What is their role in the larger system? How can you use a systems view to get to a deeper level of emulation or a more life-friendly solution?&#xA;&#xA;Nature&#39;s Unifying Patterns:&#xA;&#xA;Nature uses only the energy it needs and relies on freely available energy.&#xA;Nature recycles all materials.&#xA;Nature is resilient to disturbances.&#xA;Nature tends to optimize rather than maximize.&#xA;Nature provides mutual benefits.&#xA;Nature runs on information.&#xA;Nature uses chemistry and materials that are safe for living beings.&#xA;Nature builds using abundant resources, incorporating rare resources only sparingly.&#xA;Nature is locally attuned and responsive.&#xA;Nature uses shape to determine functionality.&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Commands&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;!help --&amp;gt; description of bot and commands.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Run Locally&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Clone the repository&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Create a &lt;code&gt;.env&lt;/code&gt; file in the root directory of your cloned repository that includes your OpenAI and Discord API keys.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;OPENAI_API_KEY = xxx&#xA;DISCORD_TOKEN = xxx&#xA;SEMANTIC_SCHOLAR_API_KEY = xxx&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;3&#34;&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Install the requirements&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Run python3 bot.py&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Create a Discord Bot (to get API key)&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Go to Discord portal online.

Give the new application a name.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Go to Bot tab in the left pannel.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Toggle SERVER MEMBERS INTENT and MESSAGE CONTENT INTENT, make sure REQUIRES OAUTH2 CODE GRANT is off.

(You&#39;ll need to create this new server in the discord app)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Run on AWS&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Clone the repository.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Input the API keys&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Go to AWS console&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Deploy an EC2 instance, and stop it&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Create an image from that EC2 instance&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Go to Cloud Formation&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Create Stack&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Add the yaml file&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Input a key pair and the image id&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Deploy and check discord&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Update Bot on AWS&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Login to AWS console&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Switch to us-east-2 (Ohio)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Type EC2 in the search bar and enter.

This process involves establishing relationships between workflows, actions, jobs, steps, etc.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;📚 &lt;strong&gt;Query Library:&lt;/strong&gt; We created a library of pre-defined queries based on research conducted by the community.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;❗ &lt;strong&gt;Report:&lt;/strong&gt; Raven has a simple way of reporting suspicious findings. As an example, it can be incorporated into the CI process for pull requests and run there.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Possible usages for Raven:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Scanner for your own organization&#39;s security&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Scanning specified organizations for bug bounty purposes&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Scan everything and report issues found to save the internet&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Research and learning purposes&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This tool provides a reliable and scalable solution for CI/CD security analysis, enabling users to query bad configurations and gain valuable insights into their codebase&#39;s security posture.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Why Raven&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the past year, Cycode Labs conducted extensive research on fundamental security issues of CI/CD systems. We examined the depths of many systems, thousands of projects, and several configurations. The conclusion is clear – the model in which security is delegated to developers has failed. This has been proven several times in our previous content:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;A simple injection scenario exposed dozens of public repositories, including popular open-source projects.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;We found that one of the most popular frontend frameworks was vulnerable to the innovative method of branch injection attack.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;We detailed a completely different attack vector, 3rd party integration risks, the most popular project on GitHub, and thousands more.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Finally, the Microsoft 365 UI framework, with more than 300 million users, is vulnerable to an additional new threat – an artifact poisoning attack.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Additionally, we found, reported, and disclosed hundreds of other vulnerabilities privately.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each of the vulnerabilities above has unique characteristics, making it nearly impossible for developers to stay up to date with the latest security trends. Unfortunately, each vulnerability shares a commonality – each exploitation can impact millions of victims.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;It was for these reasons that Raven was created, a framework for CI/CD security analysis workflows (and GitHub Actions as the first use case). In our focus, we examined complex scenarios where each issue isn&#39;t a threat on its own, but when combined, they pose a severe threat.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Setup &amp;amp;&amp;amp; Run&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get started with Raven, follow these installation instructions:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;/strong&gt;: Download the latest stable version, The install script requires &lt;code&gt;curl&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;wget&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;jq&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;curl -sSfL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CycodeLabs/raven/f020094d175ab5cd0eb10442c6f7728485cc6903/install.sh | bash&#xA;cd raven&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;or, you can download the latest release from &lt;code&gt;https://github.com/CycodeLabs/raven/releases/latest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2&lt;/strong&gt;: Create a virtual environment&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;python3 -m venv .venv&#xA;source .venv/bin/activate&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 3&lt;/strong&gt;: Build a containerized environment and install Raven&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;sudo make setup&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 4&lt;/strong&gt;: Run Raven&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;raven&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Prerequisites&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Python 3.9+&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Docker Compose v2.1.0+&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Docker Engine v1.13.0+&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Infrastructure&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Raven is using two primary docker containers: Redis and Neo4j. &lt;code&gt;make setup&lt;/code&gt; will run a &lt;code&gt;docker-compose&lt;/code&gt; command to prepare that environment.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CycodeLabs/raven/main/assets/images/infrastructure.png&#34; alt=&#34;Infrastructure&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

Currently, this behavior isn&#39;t supported.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;It is possible to run an action by referencing it locally. This creates complex behavior, as it may come from a different repository that was checked out previously. The current behavior is trying to find it in the existing repository.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;We aren&#39;t modeling the entire workflow structure.

Example use case - a user can pass a pull request title (which is controllable parameter) to an action parameter that is named &lt;code&gt;data&lt;/code&gt;. That action parameter may be used in a run command: &lt;code&gt;- run: echo ${{ inputs.data }}&lt;/code&gt;, which creates a path for a code execution.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Expand the research for findings of harmful misuse of &lt;code&gt;GITHUB_ENV&lt;/code&gt;. This may utilize the previous taint analysis as well.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Research whether &lt;code&gt;actions/github-script&lt;/code&gt; has an interesting threat landscape. If it is, it can be modeled in the graph.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Contributing&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We encourage contributions from the community to help improve our tooling and research.
