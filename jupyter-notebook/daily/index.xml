    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Dramatron uses large language models to generate coherent scripts and screenplays.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Dramatron&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/deepmind/dramatron/main/dramatron-animation.gif&#34;&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dramatron&lt;/strong&gt; uses existing, pre-trained large language models to generate long, coherent text and could be useful for authors for &lt;strong&gt;co-writing&lt;/strong&gt; theatre scripts and screenplays. Dramatron uses hierarchical story generation for consistency across the generated text. Starting from a log line, Dramatron interactively generates character descriptions, plot points, location descriptions, and dialogue. These generations provide human authors with material for compilation, editing, and rewriting.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dramatron is conceived as a writing tool and as a source of inspiration and exploration for writers. To evaluate Dramatron’s usability and capabilities, we engaged 15 playwrights and screenwriters in two-hour long user study sessions to co-write scripts alongside Dramatron.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;One concrete illustration of how Dramatron can be utilised by creative communities is how one playwright staged 4 heavily edited and rewritten scripts co-written alongside Dramatron. In the public theatre show, &lt;em&gt;Plays by Bots&lt;/em&gt;, a talented cast of experienced actors with improvisational skills gave meaning to Dramatron scripts through acting and interpretation.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;During the development of Dramatron and through discussions with industry professionals, we made several important observations:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Dramatron is a &lt;strong&gt;co-writing&lt;/strong&gt; system that has only been used in collaboration with human writers, and was not conceived or evaluated to be used autonomously.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Dramatron’s top-down hierarchical story generation structure does not correspond to every writer&#39;s writing process.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;The output of a language model may include elements of the text used to train the language model. One possible mitigation is for the human co-writer to search for substrings from outputs to help to identify plagiarism.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Dramatron may reproduce biases and stereotypes found in the corpus, and may generate offensive text. One possible mitigation is to use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://perspectiveapi.com/&#34;&gt;Perspective API&lt;/a&gt; for estimating toxicity scores of the language outputs, and filtering generations based on the Perspective API analysis.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In our pre-print paper &lt;a href=&#34;https://arxiv.org/abs/2209.14958&#34;&gt;Mirowski, Mathewson et al (2022) Co-Writing Screenplays and Theatre Scripts with Language Models: An Evaluation by Industry Professionals&lt;/a&gt; we share many reflections including how playwrights reflected that they &#34;wouldn&#39;t use [Dramatron] to write a full play,&#34; and that Dramatron&#39;s output can be &#34;formulaic.&#34; Rather, they would use Dramatron for &#34;world building,&#34; for exploring alternative stories by changing characters or plot elements, and for creative idea generation.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We are looking forward to learning if and how you might incorporate Dramatron into your own artistic practices.
