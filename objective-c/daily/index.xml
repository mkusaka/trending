    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m prototyping a new version of ObjcUnit. Let&#39;s see if something useful comes out eventually.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Prototyping a new version of ObjcUnit&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;m experimenting with a new version of ObjcUnit, a unit test framwork for Objective-C that I wrote back in 2001/2002 together with my friend and co-worker Peter Lindberg. ObjcUnit was an adaption (almost a direct translation) of jUnit to Objective-C.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;I haven&#39;t touched ObjcUnit in years. When testing on the mac today I usually go with OCUnit/SenTestingKit because it&#39;s bundled with the dev tools, but I often get frustrated with the whole setup. Testing code on the mac is cumbersome.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;I have a few ideas on how to improve the situation. Well, I have a few ideas on &lt;em&gt;how to do things differently&lt;/em&gt;. Perhaps when realized, they will also turn out to improve the state of testing on the mac. We&#39;ll see.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
