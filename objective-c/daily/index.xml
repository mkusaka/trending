    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Recreation of AfterDarks 2.0 Flying Toasters screensaver for macOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;FlyingToasters&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recreation of AfterDarks 2.0 Flying Toasters screensaver for macOS&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dissatisfied with a few of the Flying Toaster screensaver clones that exist for modern macOS, I set off to implement one that felt more true to Berkley Systems After Dark 2.0 version of my youth. Due to a breadth of legacy and modern hardware in my personal collection, I opted for ObjC as the language here but may chose to modernize this in the future. I&#39;ve also intentionally omitted collision detection and physics from the design in this initial version. I hope to add it in a subsequent version later and perhaps even add support for similar variety that Berkley Systems did through each of their After Dark Releases.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://github.com/robertventurini/FlyingToasters/raw/master/FlyingToasters.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Image of FlyingToasters&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This project was inspired by Bryan Brauns work on his project, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/bryanbraun/after-dark-css&#34;&gt;After Dark CSS&lt;/a&gt;. The image resources for the toaster and toast came from his repository directly and as he states there, are Â© 1989 Berkeley Systems Inc.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
