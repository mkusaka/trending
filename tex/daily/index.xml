    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Gary Chamberlain Lecture Notes&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This document contains the set of lecture notes from the late Gary Chamberlain&#39;s 2010 Econometrics class (EC2120) that I (Paul Goldsmith-Pinkham) took during my economics Ph.D. at Harvard University. Gary was a remarkable teacher and this class was an amazing experience for me as a young economist.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;A few things worth noting from my experience taking this course:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;The course is somewhat unique in not introducing any inference until Lecture 7 (halfway through the course). The focus prior to this is exclusively on estimation using regression.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;The lectures are linked together in groups (even though they are not marked this way). Lectures 1-3 reflect the underlying setup in notation and framework for the rest of the course. Lectures 6-9 setup inference. Lecture 9-11 discuss a general framework for using moment conditions.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;During my semester, we never got through lectures 13-15, which suggests that this is a lot of material for a single semester.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Gary would continually refer back to Lecture 4 and Lecture 9 (indeed, I have Gary&#39;s voice saying &#34;if we think back to the Note 9 framework...&#34; burned into my brain. As a result, these are also some of the longest and densest lectures.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;The last 4 sections are review problems that Gary provided for preparation for the final exam. These are very fun problems, but we were not provided solutions. So, you&#39;ll have to figure them out on your own!&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>
