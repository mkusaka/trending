This includes effects such as robots, monsters, space creatures, as well as emotional effects such as laughing, crying, clapping and more.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;[!Note] In addition, Voicelab allows you to fine-tune synthetic voices by changing pitch, volume, frequency and various sound effects. The creators of Voicemod claim that this will lead to a virtually &#34;unlimited&#34; number of voice options. Before this update, the program had over a hundred AI voice options, including examples of popular characters and famous personalities. Voicemod and other developers of similar services face legal problems by copying the voices of real people. Generating synthetic voices could remove this legal hurdle.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;[!Important] Is Voicemod free forever? In short: YES, it is! However, although Voicemod is a FREE-to-use software&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary>
