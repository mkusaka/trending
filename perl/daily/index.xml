Additionally, the default speed setting has been changed from &#34;regular&#34; to &#34;fast&#34; (adjustable in settings menu).&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Subtitles have been added for spoken dialogue during the &#34;Teach a Girl to Fish&#34; mini-game.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;In dialogue text, the speaker&#39;s name is visually differentiated by being displayed in orange, rather than just in brackets with the standard white color.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Quiz mini-games completely overhauled and localized.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;ul&gt; &#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Quiz mini-game questions completely rewritten as to give players the ability to answer them correctly, while also learning about Japanese and Ainu culture, food, and history (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerekPascarella/NakoruruTheGiftSheGaveMe-EnglishPatchDreamcast/main/#mini-games&#34;&gt;Mini-Games&lt;/a&gt; section). &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Quiz mini-game timer removed to give players time to research answers for each question.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;/ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Voice-acted dialogue audio persists across multiple dialogue boxes as to not be prematurely halted when English text consumes more than a single dialogue box (read more in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dreamcast-talk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=52&amp;amp;t=14736&amp;amp;start=30#p163650&#34;&gt;this Dreamcast-Talk.com forum post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;!--&lt;li&gt;If a player makes a series of in-game decisions that lead to a specific crucial story branch, &lt;a href=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/0vsih76.png&#34;&gt;a warning message will appear&lt;/a&gt; advising them to create a save file before proceeding.  The team decided to add this message because a player&#39;s choice at this particular prompt can result in skipping nearly half of the game&#39;s story.  Should a player choose the response that cuts the story short, it&#39;ll be abundantly clear.&lt;/li&gt;--&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Rewrote and optimized code in the functions responsible for pushing icon data to VMU LCD, thus eliminating an issue causing intermittent ignored input (i.e., button presses) on the &lt;a href=&#34;http://www.dreammods.net/dreamconn.html&#34;&gt;DreamConn+&lt;/a&gt; controller (read more in &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/DerekPascarella/status/1598008862736384001&#34;&gt;this Twitter thread&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dreamcast-talk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=52&amp;amp;t=14736&amp;amp;p=171379#p171379&#34;&gt;this Dreamcast-Talk.com forum post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;A brand-new Bonus Disc was created to provide players with a 100% fully-unlocked save, two playable songs from the game, and the first and only episode of the official &#34;Nakoruru: The Gift She Gave Me&#34; OVA. All of this content is enjoyable directly from the Bonus Disc itself on real Dreamcast hardware (read more in &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dreamcast-talk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=52&amp;amp;t=14736&amp;amp;start=50#p166767&#34;&gt;this Dreamcast-Talk.com forum post&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;The game&#39;s original soundtrack has been ripped and provided for download in WAV, MP3, FLAC, and OGG formats (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerekPascarella/NakoruruTheGiftSheGaveMe-EnglishPatchDreamcast/main/#original-soundtrack&#34;&gt;Original Soundtrack&lt;/a&gt; section).&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;About the Game&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;table&gt; &#xA; &lt;tbody&gt;&#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Original Title&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Nakoruru: Anohito Kara no Okurimono (ナコルル 〜あのひとからのおくりもの〜)&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Localized Title&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Nakoruru: The Gift She Gave Me&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Developer&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Inter-Let&#39;s&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Publisher&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Kool Kizz (クールキッズ)&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Licensor&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;SNK&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Release Date&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;2002-03-28&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Supported Peripherals&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;VGA Box, Jump Pack, Keyboard, Mouse, Controller, VMU&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;b&gt;Average Time to Completion&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;12 hours&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA; &lt;/tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt; &#xA;&lt;br&gt; Being a fan-favorite character of SNK&#39;s beloved Samurai Shodown fighting franchise, it&#39;s only natural that Nakoruru would get her own spin-off game. SNK granted developer Inter-Let&#39;s the privilege of crafting a story that explored her character in finer detail, with the result being &#34;Nakoruru: Anohito Kara no Okurimono&#34;, a visual novel game released for Windows in 2001, and Dreamcast in 2002, exclusively in Japan. To take a source material known for its intense arcade fighting thrills and adapt it into a quiet, heartfelt text-based adventure makes for quite the interesting gaming experience. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; The game&#39;s story is told from the perspective of seven-year-old Mikato, an orphan who is taken in by the people of the snowy village of Kamui Kotan. She is selected by the village&#39;s chief, Outada, to serve as assistant to the shrine maiden Nakoruru, somebody the people of Kamui Kotan admire for her strength, dependability, and outward positivity. Mikato soon realizes, however, that deep down, Nakoruru is harboring an intense sorrow... &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; The gameplay of &#34;Nakoruru&#34; is simple, and familiar to those who have played a visual novel before. Advance the story with a button press, and occasionally make choices, some of which greatly affect the game&#39;s narrative. Also included throughout the story are several basic but charming mini-games. These include quizzes, fishing, dodging enemy attacks, and more. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; For those new to the genre, you can learn more about visual novels in &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7wOtv-J7tOI&#34;&gt;this fantastic video by Bowl of Lentils&lt;/a&gt;. &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Helpful Tips&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;img align=&#34;right&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/bmjnVyB.png&#34;&gt;&#34;Nakoruru: The Gift She Gave Me&#34; is a visual novel, and as such, there are certain things players should know about the genre before jumping in. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; As is common with games of this type, players are presented with various choices throughout their adventure. The decision a player makes at these prompts will affect the story, sometimes drastically. For those who want to see the entire story, it&#39;s suggested that they save their game whenever presented with a decision prompt. The game offers its players plenty of save slots to do so. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; If a player makes a series of in-game decisions that lead to a specific crucial story branch, they&#39;ll be presented with the prompt shown in this section&#39;s screenshot. It&#39;s strongly advised that a save file is created before proceeding, as one of the two decisions results in a player skipping nearly half of the story. The player&#39;s response to all other prompts can affect which scenes they experience, but all still ensure they see a full-length version of the story. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; Note that a player&#39;s performance during the various mini-games will also affect which parts of the story they&#39;ll see, although the difference between which scenes are presented after either good or poor performance in said mini-games is very minimal. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; Other tips: &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;During the first play of the game, players should allow the entire introduction sequence (before the title screen) to play in full. It functions as a flash-floward and is revisited in the final scene.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;It&#39;s recommended to adjust the game&#39;s text fade-in speed to &#34;instant&#34; (appearing as &#34;INST.&#34; in settings menu), as it significantly helps with pacing. While this patch has increased the text fade-in speed and also changed the default setting from &#34;regular&#34; to &#34;fast&#34;, it was decided to leave the &#34;instant&#34; option in the player&#39;s hands, as they may enjoy the fade-in effect which is lost with &#34;instant&#34; mode.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Timing an attack in the &#34;Bear Shodown&#34; mini-game (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerekPascarella/NakoruruTheGiftSheGaveMe-EnglishPatchDreamcast/main/#mini-games&#34;&gt;Mini-Games&lt;/a&gt; section) can be difficult. If a player is unable to beat it, they should adjust the mini-game difficulty level to &#34;easy&#34; in the settings menu, then follow along with &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiokxy_Q7Vw&amp;amp;t=685s&#34;&gt;this recorded gameplay footage&lt;/a&gt; to reveal the perfect moment to strike with their attack. &lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;A Note on Emulators and ODEs&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;img align=&#34;right&#34; src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/PbVgeuJ.jpg&#34; width=&#34;180&#34;&gt;Throughout the development of this translation patch, testing was performed across the spectrum of both emulators and ODEs, as well as optical disc. Interestingly, this game (both in its original form and in its patched form) has one very mild issue when played via emulator or some ODEs, causing a texture flicker in between some scene transitions. When this occurs, the on-screen character(s) will flicker slightly before fading away. This is caused by faster data-read speeds than developers originally intended (or tested against) when played via GD-ROM. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; Please understand that this texture flicker occurs in the original, unaltered version of the game too, and was in no way introduced by the translation patch. It&#39;s not a game-breaking issue, but instead strictly cosmetic. Furthermore, those playing this game on an optical disc (i.e., a CDI burned to a CD-R) will not experience it. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; The solution to said problem is to artificially limit the speed at which data is read from the disc image in order to more closely mimic the performance of a GD-ROM drive. While achievable on ODEs, no such a setting has been found in any emulators used during development and testing (&#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/flyinghead/flycast&#34;&gt;Flycast&lt;/a&gt;, &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;http://demul.emulation64.com/&#34;&gt;Demul&lt;/a&gt;, &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://segaretro.org/NullDC&#34;&gt;NullDC&lt;/a&gt;, and &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://gitlab.com/simulant/community/lxdream-nitro&#34;&gt;LXDream Nitro&lt;/a&gt;). Below are the configurations needed to impose the required data-read limit. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;GDEMU&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt; Two options exist for users of authentic GDEMUs, or the more recent clones that can be upgraded. &#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt; Preferrably, use firmware &#xA; &lt;a href=&#34;https://gdemu.wordpress.com/firmware/updating-gdemu/&#34;&gt;version 5.20.5&lt;/a&gt;, where Deunan updated the list of games requiring optimal timings to include &#34;Nakoruru: The Gift She Gave Me&#34;. This version also includes the same fix for mild texture stuttering in another English translation patch, &#34;&#xA; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/DerekPascarella/SakuraWarsColumns2-EnglishPatchDreamcast&#34;&gt;Sakura Wars: Columns 2&lt;/a&gt;&#34;. &#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt; Alternatively, users not willing to upgrade to 5.20.5 (but still using version 5.20 or newer) can impose a global read-limit by setting the &#xA; &lt;tt&gt;read_limit&lt;/tt&gt; parameter to &#xA; &lt;tt&gt;1250&lt;/tt&gt; in the &#xA; &lt;tt&gt;GDEMU.ini&lt;/tt&gt; configuration file in the root of their SD card (&#xA; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/DerekPascarella/NakoruruTheGiftSheGaveMe-EnglishPatchDreamcast/raw/main/ode_configs/GDEMU.ini&#34;&gt;see example configuration file here&lt;/a&gt;). More can be read about the &#xA; &lt;tt&gt;read_limit&lt;/tt&gt; option on the &#xA; &lt;a href=&#34;https://gdemu.wordpress.com/operation/gdemu-operation/&#34;&gt;GDEMU Operation&lt;/a&gt; page. It&#39;s important to mention that globally limiting speed at which data is read from the SD card will cause incompatibility with some Atomiswave conversions, hence the recommendation to use firmware version 5.20.5. &#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt; Users on a pre-5.20 firmware version will still be able to play the game, however the aforementioned texture flicker will occur intermittently with no way to prevent it. &#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;MODE&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt; Inside the disc image folder, create a &#xA; &lt;tt&gt;mode.cfg&lt;/tt&gt; file containing the following entries: &#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt; &#xA; &lt;pre&gt;&#xA;Flags=8&#xA;BlockDelay=4&#xA;&lt;/pre&gt; A pre-built version of this configuration file is available &#xA; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/DerekPascarella/NakoruruTheGiftSheGaveMe-EnglishPatchDreamcast/raw/main/ode_configs/mode.cfg&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. To learn more about MODE configuration files, see the &#xA; &lt;a href=&#34;https://wiki.terraonion.com/index.php/Config_Files#MODE_-_Dreamcast_Config&#34;&gt;Configuration Files&lt;/a&gt; wiki. &#xA; &lt;br&gt;&#xA; &lt;br&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;USB-GDROM&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt; No additional configuration is required. Texture flicker does not occur. &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Controls&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;img align=&#34;right&#34; src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/TBXZHWm.jpg&#34;&gt;This game supports not only the standard Dreamcast controller, but both the keyboard and mouse peripherals, too. Jump Pack support is also implemented for vibration during certain scenes, an option which can be turned off in the game&#39;s settings menu. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Controller&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;br&gt; &#xA; &lt;table&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tbody&gt;&#xA;   &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Proceed with dialogue / Confirm selection&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; A button&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Go back / Exit menu&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; B button&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Skip dialogue&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; X button&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Auto-pilot dialogue progression&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; L button&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Toggle dialogue box visibility&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; R button&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Pause menu&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Start button&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&#xA; &lt;/table&gt; &#xA; &lt;br&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Keyboard&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;br&gt; &#xA; &lt;table&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tbody&gt;&#xA;   &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Proceed with dialogue / Confirm selection&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Enter / Space / X&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Go back / Exit menu&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Del / Esc / Z&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Skip dialogue&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; PgDown&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Auto-pilot dialogue progression&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; F3&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Toggle dialogue box visibility&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; F2&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Pause menu&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; F1&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&#xA; &lt;/table&gt; &#xA; &lt;br&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;b&gt;Mouse&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;br&gt; &#xA; &lt;table&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tbody&gt;&#xA;   &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Proceed with dialogue / Confirm selection&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Left click&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Go back / Exit menu&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Right click&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Skip dialogue&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; &lt;i&gt;Unimplemented&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Auto-pilot dialogue progression&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; &lt;i&gt;Unimplemented&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Toggle dialogue box visibility&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; &lt;i&gt;Unimplemented&lt;/i&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Pause menu&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;    &lt;td&gt; Click scroll wheel&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tbody&gt;&#xA; &lt;/table&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Mini-Games&lt;/h2&gt; There are eight separate mini-games scattered throughout this adventure. One of these games challenges players with a host of quiz questions. As mentioned in the &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerekPascarella/NakoruruTheGiftSheGaveMe-EnglishPatchDreamcast/main/#whats-changed&#34;&gt;What&#39;s Changed&lt;/a&gt; section, the timer for these questions has been removed for this translation patch. Without removing the timer, answering any of the quiz questions correctly would be highly improbable. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; As a bonus, a complete bank of questions and answers has been compiled and is &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerekPascarella/NakoruruTheGiftSheGaveMe-EnglishPatchDreamcast/main/QUIZ_ANSWER_BANK.md&#34;&gt;available here&lt;/a&gt;. Note that each of the three quizzes holds a bank of 30 questions, but only ten are selected at random. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; For assistance with the &#34;Bear Shodown&#34; mini-game, see the &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerekPascarella/NakoruruTheGiftSheGaveMe-EnglishPatchDreamcast/main/#helpful-tips&#34;&gt;Helpful Tips&lt;/a&gt; section. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; &#xA;&lt;table align=&#34;center&#34;&gt; &#xA; &lt;tbody&gt;&#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td width=&#34;50%&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/KbswMa4.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td width=&#34;50%&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/raCB7Nt.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td width=&#34;50%&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/09R5Ylr.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td width=&#34;50%&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/rnF5OO9.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td width=&#34;50%&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/sTpbLY8.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td width=&#34;50%&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/0FasiBQ.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt;&#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td width=&#34;50%&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/f2JlFDh.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td width=&#34;50%&#34; align=&#34;center&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/mjn1umh.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA; &lt;/tbody&gt;&#xA;&lt;/table&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Bonus Disc&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;img align=&#34;right&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/z4MCEf2.gif&#34;&gt;When developing English translation patches for the SEGA Dreamcast, developers have the option to leverage the baked-in Dream Passport web browser (commonly found in Japanese games) to include bonus content. In the case of &#34;Nakoruru: The Gift She Gave Me&#34;, no such browser was bundled with, and accessible from, the game itself. Instead, this patch ships with an entirely separate, standalone Bonus Disc. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; Offered in both GDI and CDI formats, the Bonus disc treats players with the following extras: &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;A 100% fully-unlocked save file, granting players access to all of the game&#39;s built-in extra content (accessible from the &#34;EXTRAS&#34; option in the game&#39;s main menu). Note that this doesn&#39;t affect story progress, as this is a system save file, separate from story progress save files.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;A well-produced, 30-minute OVA (original video animation) produced in 2002 by ARMS featuring the same characters and setting as the game. Note that the screensaver timer has been removed with an assembly hack so that the entirety of this video can be watched uninterrupted.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;A beautiful rendition of &#34;Miko no Densho Uta&#34; (&#34;Traditional Shrine Maiden&#39;s Song&#34;) performed by Nakoruru&#39;s voice actress, Harumi Ikoma.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;The gorgeous song sung by Manari&#39;s voice actress, Ayako Kawasumi, when she finally works up the courage to sing in front of others in the game.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; More can be read about the Bonus Disc in &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dreamcast-talk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=52&amp;amp;t=14736&amp;amp;start=50#p166767&#34;&gt;this Dreamcast-Talk.com forum post&lt;/a&gt;.

Four of the main characters are each featured separately in these applications (Nakoruru, Manari, Rimururu, and Rera), and are accessible from the main menu by navigating to &#34;EXTRAS&#34; and then &#34;VMU APPS&#34;. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; Once downloaded to a VMU, players can navigate to the game icon (♠), where they&#39;ll be presented with an animated icon of the selected character. The current time will also be displayed. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; Pressing the A button will display an option to hold both A and B buttons to reveal a quote from the character. Pressing B again returns back to the current time. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; More can be read about the process of reverse-engineering these VMU clock applications in &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.dreamcast-talk.com/forum/viewtopic.php?f=52&amp;amp;t=14736&amp;amp;start=30#p161265&#34;&gt;this Dreamcast-Talk.com forum post&lt;/a&gt;. &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Disc Content&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;img align=&#34;right&#34; width=&#34;200&#34; height=&#34;162&#34; src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/lUwilNu.png&#34;&gt;As is quite common with Dreamcast titles, the 35 MB single-density area of this game&#39;s GD-ROM contains bonus content. Accessible by players who insert their original game disc into their computer&#39;s CD-ROM drive, this content came in the form of six clock applications. These applications are 32-bit Windows binaries which have been tested all the way up to Windows 10. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; While these small bonus programs originally displayed their menu in Japanese, they have been fully translated into English for this release. To access the menu, simply right-click anywhere on the clock face. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; Each clock application executable is available in the &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerekPascarella/NakoruruTheGiftSheGaveMe-EnglishPatchDreamcast/main/disc_content&#34;&gt;disc_content&lt;/a&gt; folder. &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Disc and Box Art&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;img width=&#34;205&#34; height=&#34;205&#34; align=&#34;right&#34; src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/ywRDOGQ.png&#34;&gt;By default, the Bonus Disc and main game itself both use brand-new disc art 0GDTEX.PVR files, which look nice when displayed in GDMenu on GDEMU. However, for those using &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mrneo240/GDMENUCardManager/wiki/Instructions&#34;&gt;openMenu&lt;/a&gt; on GDEMU who prefer box art, I&#39;ve provided alternative versions for both disc images in the &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/DerekPascarella/NakoruruTheGiftSheGaveMe-EnglishPatchDreamcast/tree/main/menu_art&#34;&gt;menu_art&lt;/a&gt; folder. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; For GDMenu users who prefer box art, both the Bonus Disc and main game GDIs can be extracted and rebuilt to include that artwork instead. One such tutorial on how to do so can be found &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3_-9Ur3RvA0&#34;&gt;here on YouTube&lt;/a&gt;. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; Because the MODE uses Redump checksums to match artwork to each game, neither the Bonus Disc nor the main game will be identified, and no artwork will be displayed. &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Original Soundtrack&lt;/h2&gt; Players are treated to beautiful musical arrangements all throughout &#34;Nakoruru: The Gift She Gave Me&#34;, composed by two longtime SNK legends. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://snk.fandom.com/wiki/Tate_Norio&#34;&gt;Yasuo Yamate&lt;/a&gt; (山手 安生), better known to SNK fans as Tate Norio, is a Japanese music composer and audio engineer who was hired by SNK in 1986. Before working for SNK, he composed soundtracks for many games, such as &#34;Sonic the Hedgehog&#34;, the &#34;Ninja Gaiden&#34; series, the &#34;Final Fight&#34; series, the &#34;Contra&#34; series, and more. He also helped in the composition of music from &#34;Street Fighter II&#34;, &#34;Super Hang On&#34;, and &#34;Shadow Dancer&#34;.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://snk.fandom.com/wiki/Yamapy-1&#34;&gt;Yasumasa Yamada&lt;/a&gt; (山田 泰正), also known as Yamapy-1, is a music composer and sound editor who was hired by SNK in 1989 as a member of the sound team.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://mega.nz/folder/zAs12K6A#Cas7lg4uOkDZHs_6H895yA&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; the original in-game soundtrack, available in WAV, MP3, FLAC, and OGG formats. &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Known Issues&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;img align=&#34;right&#34; width=&#34;300&#34; height=&#34;225&#34; src=&#34;https://i.imgur.com/nKu2rwU.png&#34;&gt;From this project&#39;s onset, the goal has been to deliver a completely polished English translation patch free of any bugs or imperperfections. Thankfully, there are no game-breaking bugs to speak of whatsoever. However, there is one minor cosmetic/functional issue with this game&#39;s history feature. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; Designed to allow players to scroll back through dialogue history, this one section of the game presented a slew of technical challenges. Although &#34;Nakoruru: The Gift She Gave Me&#34; leverages dozens of separate text-rendering functions for different parts of the game, all of them but one were reined in after a bit of effort. Unfortunately, even after months of assembly hacking attempts, the unique (and bizarre) history viewer is presently in a partially broken state. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; Currently, the game will at least display the last 100 dialogue instances, which required a reallocation of RAM in order to fit the now twice-as-large text entries. However, each is cut off after 78 characters, rather than the new maximum of 156. Furthermore, each entry appears with improperly placed linebreaks. To help soften the visual appearance, text has been centered, rather than kept left-justified. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; Note that the current implementation of the history feature does not represent the entirety of the progress made in hacking it. Rather, it&#39;s a compromise that guarantees no game-breaking bugs. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; As stated, this issue in no way causes crashing or any other form of breakage. That being said, there are plans to address and fully fix the history feature in a future release. &#xA;&lt;br&gt;&#xA;&lt;br&gt; Bugs or typos found during gameplay can be reported by &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/DerekPascarella/NakoruruTheGiftSheGaveMe-EnglishPatchDreamcast/issues/new&#34;&gt;submitting a new issue&lt;/a&gt; to this project page. &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Messages From the Team&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Derek Pascarella (ateam):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;In July of 2021, I began researching visual novels on the SEGA Dreamcast. Given that no titles from this genre were brought to the West during the console&#39;s lifecycle, I felt it important that one of the Dreamcast&#39;s best visual novels should be the focus of my next English translation patch project. After playing through a few of the candidates, I eventually settled on, and fell in love with, this one. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I knew the process of analyzing, extracting, translating, hacking, rebuilding, and finally playtesting a game of that scale would be arduous and time-consuming. However, it takes tremendous passion and effort to accomplish anything good and worthwhile in life, and I was determined to see it through. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; With this resolve at the forefront of my mind, I began spreading the word that I was looking to amass a team of translators and editors. Thankfully, the wonderful people named in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerekPascarella/NakoruruTheGiftSheGaveMe-EnglishPatchDreamcast/main/#credits&#34;&gt;Credits&lt;/a&gt; section above answered the call. The events that proceeded live on within me as experiences and memories that I wouldn&#39;t trade for all the money in the world. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; From a technical perspective, &#34;Nakoruru: The Gift She Gave Me&#34; presented many, many challenges. Unlike previous English translation patches I&#39;ve developed, this game required extensive Hitachi SH4 Assembly work to implement a multitude of changes and quality-of-life improvements. To get the job done, I spent countless hours combing through Hitachi&#39;s technical documentation to soak up as much as I could. By combining Ghidra, Cheat Engine, and the Demul emulator, I was able to devise a functional workflow for reverse-engineering, modifying, and testing. A big &#34;grazie mille&#34; goes out to my friend &lt;a href=&#34;https://twitter.com/VincentNL_&#34;&gt;VincentNL&lt;/a&gt; for helping to refine this workflow so that patch developers like me can be as productive as possible. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Morning after morning, I woke up several hours before my alarm clock would normally sound off so that I could squeeze in as much time as possible to work on hacking this game. I thought about how to solve problems when I laid my head down on my pillow at night. I had eureka moments while sitting in traffic. In short, &#34;Nakoruru: The Gift She Gave Me&#34; consumed my nearly every waking moment. In that way, a target game serves as something of a cruel mistress to romhackers and translation patch developers. As bizarre as that may sound, several others in the scene agree with me. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Aside from cutting my teeth on more advanced forms of assembly hacking, this game also opened my eyes to the minority Ainu people of Japan. Admittedly, this is an ethnic group of which I had no previous knowledge. Its food, culture, and language were the source of much research carried out by my fantastic translation team. I myself even spent a fair bit of time aiding in said research, as well. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; That said, I worked hard to ensure that players are taught about the Ainu in every way possible while playing this game. Special Ainu-language terminology is introduced a great number of times during the story, accompanied by an explanation in order to educate players. The same is true for the completely overhauled quiz mini-games (read more in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DerekPascarella/NakoruruTheGiftSheGaveMe-EnglishPatchDreamcast/main/#mini-games&#34;&gt;Mini-Games&lt;/a&gt; section), which serve to reinforce, or introduce for the first time, nuggets of knowledge on Ainu food, history, culture, and language. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Ultimately, I feel that &#34;Nakoruru: The Gift She Gave Me&#34; offers its player a genuine, heartfelt tale of friendship, family, love, loss, and of course, growing up. I will forever cherish the friends I made along the way while bringing this game to you all in English for the first time. From the bottom of my heart, I hope everyone out there who gives this game a try finds in it something truly special, and something that leaves a lasting impact on them for years to come.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Marshal Wong:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;Thanks for playing Nakoruru. This was my first involvement in a translation project and I hope you are/were touched by the story as I was. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; There is the Chinese saying 塞翁失馬 (Sāi Wēng Shī Mǎ), which essentially mean that blessings and misfortunes can both be disguised. This describes how I ended up getting involved in this project. I had two DCHDMIs that I had bought to install, one for a friend and one for myself. I had beginners luck in installing the first one for my friend (blessing), but that made me overconfident in installing the second one. I screwed that one up bad enough (misfortune) that I joined the Classic Gaming Discord for help. I just happened to see Derek&#39;s post saying that he was putting together a team to translate Nakoruru, and, as the saying goes, the rest is history! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; This is for you, cyo: Thanks for fixing my shit soldering job. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Thank you to Derek for letting me join you in this translation journey. This took longer that we initially expected, but probably not as long as we thought it would eventually take. It&#39;s been a pleasure working with you and thanks for always being open to suggestions. I can only dream of reaching your assembly hacking skills. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Thanks to LewisJFC for you great edits and dealing with Mikato&#39;s inability to stay in the same tense. Keep up the great work on the Dreamcast Junkyard! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Thanks to my fellow translators, Piggy and Duralumin, for joining the fray. Piggy for all your SNK knowledge, of which I was sorely lacking. Duralumin for your translating experience. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Looking forward to working and learning from you more on another project!&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Lewis Cox (LewisJFC):&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;I was made aware of &#34;Nakoruru: The Gift She Gave Me&#34; by my Dreamcast Junkyard colleague and friend, Mike. On a system that received over 100 visual novels, Nakoruru really stands out as a high-quality title in its genre, with intrigue only aided further by its association with SNK&#39;s beloved Samurai Shodown/Spirits franchise. Despite their niche appeal in the West, I do really enjoy playing visual novels. Naturally, this means that I also have an affinity for fan translation projects too, as without them, some of the best visual novels could never have been experienced by people like myself who cannot speak Japanese. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Through my writing for The Dreamcast Junkyard, I got to know fan translation scholar (and gentleman), Derek Pascarella. Through our conversations, I got to learn more about the assembly line process many fan translations utilise to get stuff done. As a fiction writer with editing experience, I told Derek that I&#39;d be down to assist him with future projects. When he told me he was considering a fan translation of Nakoruru... well, I signed right up. My motivators? One: help a friend. Two: bring Nakoruru to the English-speaking Dreamcast community, and three... if I helped this translation project through to completion, I&#39;d finally be able to play a game I&#39;d been wanting to play for the longest time! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Some might wonder if taking on a project as big as Nakoruru for my first go as a lead editor was a real trial by fire, but... no. I&#39;ve had the best team anyone could ask for. Everyone involved with this project has always been patient and quick to lend a hand if they could (busy life schedules permitting, of course). Thank you to Derek, Marshal and Duralumin for always helping me to figure out whatever line I&#39;d been overthinking that day (turns out that sometimes overthinking can lead to great results). &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; As for Nakoruru... I have no hesitation when I say that regardless of my involvement with this project, I would have loved this game anyway. I knew I had a good feeling about Nakoruru, and it definitely paid off. If you&#39;re a fan of visual novels, the Dreamcast or Samurai Shodown (or even all three), please give it a try. Mikato&#39;s tale is not only beautiful and moving, but funny and wholesome too. A great all-rounder, with atmosphere in spades. I hope you all learn to love this story and its characters as much as me and my team have. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Finally, thank you to all the great minds in the Dreamcast scene who are constantly working to keep this amazing console&#39;s legacy alive... the dream never dies! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; P.S. If you have to make a repro of this translation, at least send me one too! That shit would look sick on my shelf.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;Duralumin:&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;Samurai Shodown is special to me. Growing up, me and the basement crew used to get absolutely blasted and cycle through our cache of retro games on hang nights, and Samurai Shodown always played an integral part. We would play round after round, switching up versions so we could play our favorite characters. We used to howl, &#34;ALL THE THINGS WILL BE BROKEN,&#34; and throw bottles at the wall and headbutt eachother. So, I was pretty much sold at &#34;Samurai Shodown Spinoff Visual Novel&#34;. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I&#39;m glad I could work alongside my fellow translators, Piggy and Marshalwong. There was a lot of volume to this game, and they both did a good job keeping up with scripts. We all appreciated their communicative and responsive treatment if anything came up; That kind of care and attention doesn&#39;t come lightly, and makes the difference in a narrative experience like this. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Derek, I am very sure, is a witch, or perhaps a warlock of some sort. Every single time I entreated him for a few more characters per line, or to very simply find room for a mere entire new character set in italics, the answer was always &#34;probably not but let me check&#34;. But lo and behold, he would return from his dark dimension a week later saying &#34;you&#39;ll never guess what came to me in a dream.&#34; Ia! Ia! To see such dreams! He was also very helpful in streamlining the workflow and any communications, couldn&#39;t ask for more in our almighty overseer. Ia! Ia! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; Lewis... I&#39;m sorry. I made you get so many emails. I hope it doesn&#39;t send you another email every time I edited a comment I already committed. That&#39;s a lot of emails. Jesus christ. I... I&#39;m so, so, sorry. Please check the sequence from scd_12_72 to 90, but also, sorry. &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; I hope everyone likes this video game. It was all for you. All the dark magic and torments, all for you! &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt; If nothing else, remember this: Nakoruru is your friend. Nakoruru loves you. All the things must be broken. En Garde.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt;</summary>
