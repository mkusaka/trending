    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Audio/music player for Emacs&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;p&gt;#+title: listen.el&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This library aims to provide a simple audio/music player for Emacs. It should &#34;just work,&#34; with little-to-no configuration, have intuitive commands, and be easily extended and customized. (Contrast to setting up EMMS, or having to configure external players like MPD.) A &lt;del&gt;transient&lt;/del&gt; menu, under the command &lt;del&gt;listen&lt;/del&gt;, is the primary entry point.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The only external dependency is VLC, which is currently the only player backend that is supported. (Other backends may easily be added; see library &lt;del&gt;listen-vlc&lt;/del&gt; for example.) Track metadata is read using EMMS&#39;s native Elisp metadata library, which has been imported into this package.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Queues are provided as the means to play consecutive tracks, and they are shown in a &lt;del&gt;vtable&lt;/del&gt;-based view buffer. They are persisted between sessions using the &lt;del&gt;persist&lt;/del&gt; library, and they may be bookmarked.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The primary interface to one&#39;s music library is through the filesystem, by selecting a file to play, or by adding files and directories to a queue. Although MPD is not required, support is provided for finding files from a local MPD server&#39;s library using MPD&#39;s metadata searching.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;A simple &#34;library&#34; view is provided that shows a list of files organized into a hierarchy by genre, date, artist, album, etc. (This will be made more configurable and useful in the future.)&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note a silly limitation: a track may be present in a queue only once (but who would want to have a track more than once in a playlist).&lt;/p&gt;</summary>
