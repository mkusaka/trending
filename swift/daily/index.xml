    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;macOS tool to limit maximum charging percentage&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;AlDente 🍝&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;MacOS menu bar tool to limit maximum charging percentage&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Don&#39;t overcook your battery! Keep it fresh and chewy with AlDente.&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Why do I need this?&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Li-Ion batteries (like the one in your MacBook) last the longest when operating between 20 and 80 percent. Keeping your battery at 100% at all times can shorten the lifespan of your MacBook significantly. More information can be found here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-415-how-to-charge-and-when-to-charge&#34;&gt;https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-415-how-to-charge-and-when-to-charge&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;What’s AlDente Pro?&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;AlDente Pro is our paid version of AlDente. It has many more features such as Heat Protection, Sailing Mode, Top Up, Calibration Mode,... It offers a better design and has live status icons. If you are interested in getting the most out of your battery, check out our website: &lt;a href=&#34;https://apphousekitchen.com/&#34;&gt;https://apphousekitchen.com/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;AlDente Pro is now available in Setapp too: &lt;a href=&#34;https://setapp.com/apps/aldente-pro&#34;&gt;https://setapp.com/apps/aldente-pro&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Features of AlDente Free&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Charge Limiter allows you to set your maximum charging percentage between 20 and 100 percent. You can either set it by using the slide bar or by typing in the desired percentage in the field above and pressing enter afterwards. Read more about the Charge Limiter feature here: &lt;a href=&#34;https://apphousekitchen.com/feature-explanation-charge-limiter/&#34;&gt;https://apphousekitchen.com/feature-explanation-charge-limiter/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Discharge - This feature allows your MacBook to run completely on Battery even if it is plugged in. Therefore, you can actively discharge your MacBook to a more healthy percentage. Unfortunately, while Discharge is activated, clamshell mode is not supported due to technical limitations.

Usually, the operating system will take a minute or two registering the changes, so be patient. You can check if it&#39;s working by setting the max. percentage to e.g.: 80%. After a while, clicking on your battery icon will report &#34;Battery is not charging&#34; if you have more than ≈73% left, even though your charger is connected. Notice that in this state, your MacBook is still powered by the charger, but the battery is not charging anymore.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For some reason, macOS will always try to squeeze in a few more percent than specified. For example, if you set yours to 80% it will stop charging at around 83%, so be patient.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;IMPORTANT: Keeping your battery at a lower percentage, such as under 80%, over weeks without doing full cycles (100%-0%) can result in a disturbed battery calibration. When this happens, your Macbook might turn off with 40-50% left or your battery capacity will drop significantly. However, this is only due to a disturbed battery calibration and not because of a faulty or degraded battery. To avoid this issue, we recommend doing at least one full cycle (0%-100%) every two weeks. Even if your battery calibration gets disturbed, doing 4+ full cycles will recalibrate your battery and the capacity will go up again.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;details&gt; &#xA; &lt;summary&gt;IT DOES NOT WORK???&lt;/summary&gt; Firstly, AlDente does only prevent your Mac from charging more than you specify, it does NOT automatically drain your battery to the specified percentage. Secondly, make sure you have Apple&#39;s &#34;Optimized battery charging&#34; disabled, keeping it on will result in slow charging beyond the charge limit. Lastly, check the next question regarding the behavior of AlDente while your MacBook is in sleep or powered off. &#xA;&lt;/details&gt; &#xA;&lt;details&gt; &#xA; &lt;summary&gt;CHARGE LIMITER DOES NOT WORK! :(&lt;/summary&gt; AlDente Free can not control the charging behavior of your MacBook while it is in sleep, or shut down. Therefore, it will continue to charge to 100% when you close the lid or shut it down. AlDente Pro has features called &#34;Stop charging when sleeping&#34; and &#34;Stop charging when powered off&#34; to counteract this behavior. You can read more about these features in our blog: https://apphousekitchen.com/feature-explanation-stop-charging-when-sleeping/ https://apphousekitchen.com/feature-explanation-stop-charging-when-powered-off-app-closed/ &#xA;&lt;/details&gt; &#xA;&lt;details&gt; &#xA; &lt;summary&gt;WHY DOES MY MACBOOK KEEP CHARGING WHEN IT IS POWERED OFF?&lt;/summary&gt; AlDente Free can not control the charging behavior of your MacBook while it is in sleep, or shut down. Therefore, it will continue to charge to 100% when you close the lid or shut it down. AlDente Pro has features called &#34;Stop charging when sleeping&#34; and &#34;Stop charging when powered off&#34; to counteract this behavior. You can read more about these features in our blog: https://apphousekitchen.com/feature-explanation-stop-charging-when-sleeping/ https://apphousekitchen.com/feature-explanation-stop-charging-when-powered-off-app-closed/ &#xA;&lt;/details&gt; &#xA;&lt;details&gt; &#xA; &lt;summary&gt;WHY DOES MY MACBOOK KEEP CHARGING WHEN IT IS IN SLEEP?&lt;/summary&gt; AlDente Free can not control the charging behavior of your MacBook while it is in sleep, or shut down. Therefore, it will continue to charge to 100% when you close the lid or shut it down. AlDente Pro has features called &#34;Stop charging when sleeping&#34; and &#34;Stop charging when powered off&#34; to counteract this behavior. You can read more about these features in our blog: * https://apphousekitchen.com/feature-explanation-stop-charging-when-sleeping/ * https://apphousekitchen.com/feature-explanation-stop-charging-when-powered-off-app-closed/ &#xA;&lt;/details&gt; &#xA;&lt;details&gt; &#xA; &lt;summary&gt;HOW TO UNINSTALL?&lt;/summary&gt; Take a look at our blog post here: https://apphousekitchen.com/how-to-uninstall-aldente-pro/ &#xA;&lt;/details&gt; &#xA;&lt;details&gt; &#xA; &lt;summary&gt;DO I HAVE TO DISABLE APPLE&#39;S &#34;OPTIMIZED BATTERY CHARGING&#34;?&lt;/summary&gt; Yes! Leaving it on results in slow charging, even when AlDente is trying to inhibit it. &#xA;&lt;/details&gt; &#xA;&lt;details&gt; &#xA; &lt;summary&gt;WHY DOES DISCHARGE NOT WORK IN CLAMSHELL MODE?&lt;/summary&gt; Discharge in Clamshell mode is only supported in AlDente Pro. &#xA;&lt;/details&gt; &#xA;&lt;details&gt; &#xA; &lt;summary&gt;HELP, SAILING MODE DOES NOT WORK!?&lt;/summary&gt; The Sailing Mode is not intended to actively discharge your battery. Therefore, your MacBook will barely lose any energy even in Sailing Mode, since the power brick is the main source of energy. So do not worry when the battery percentage does not change even if the Sailing Mode is activated. Sailing Mode is still doing its thing. You can read more about what the Sailing Mode actually does here: https://apphousekitchen.com/feature-explanation-sailing-mode/ &#xA;&lt;/details&gt; &#xA;&lt;details&gt; &#xA; &lt;summary&gt;WHY DOES THE SAILING MODE NOT CHARGE AND DISCHARGE THE MACBOOK BETWEEN A CERTAIN RANGE?&lt;/summary&gt; Unlike the common belief, it is actually way more unhealthy for a battery to always get cycled between a reasonable range (for example between 30% and 70%) than to just stay at a healthy percentage (for example 80%). This is due to even reasonable charge cycling adding a lot of charge cycles which results in more and faster battery degradation over time than just using the MacBook plugged in at a healthy percentage. However, this does not mean that you should not use your MacBook remotely. MacBooks are portable devices but if you use your MacBook in your office plugged in, it is better to just limit charging to a healthy percentage than to cycle between a certain range. You can read more about what the Sailing Mode actually does here: https://apphousekitchen.com/feature-explanation-sailing-mode/ &#xA;&lt;/details&gt; &#xA;&lt;details&gt; &#xA; &lt;summary&gt;HELP MY BATTERY CAPACITY DROPPED AND MY MACBOOK TURNS OFF WITH 50% LEFT OR STAYS AT 100% FOR HOURS!!!&lt;/summary&gt; Keeping your battery at a lower percentage, such as under 80%, over weeks without doing full cycles (100%-0%-100%) can result in a disturbed battery calibration. When this happens, your Macbook might turn off with 40-50% left or it will stay at 100% for hours and your battery capacity can drop significantly. However, this is only due to a disturbed battery calibration and not because of a faulty or degraded battery. To avoid this issue, we recommend doing at least one full cycle (0%-100%) every two weeks. Even if your battery calibration gets disturbed, doing 4-5 full cycles will recalibrate your battery and the capacity will go up again. AlDente Pro has a feature called Calibration Mode(https://apphousekitchen.com/feature-explanation-calibration-mode-2/), which will automatically do a full cycle when started. You can read more about the calibration of &#34;smart&#34; batteries here: https://batteryuniversity.com/article/bu-603-how-to-calibrate-a-smart-battery &#xA;&lt;/details&gt; &#xA;&lt;details&gt; &#xA; &lt;summary&gt;WHAT IS ALDENTE CLASSIC?&lt;/summary&gt; AlDente Classic is our original version of AlDente. First introduced in 2020 and further developed until March 2021. With a complete rewrite of the code of AlDente and the introduction of AlDente Pro, we decided to rename the original AlDente in AlDente Classic and use the name AlDente (Free) or AlDente Pro with synchronous versioning between these two from now on. &#xA;&lt;/details&gt; &#xA;&lt;details&gt; &#xA; &lt;summary&gt;WHY IS ALDENTE NOT SUPPORTED BY OLDER VERSIONS OF MACOS AND ARE YOU PLANNING TO SUPPORT OLDER MACOS VERSIONS IN THE FUTURE?&lt;/summary&gt; Due to SwiftUI not being compatible with older versions of macOS, AlDente is only compatible with macOS 11 Big Sur on newer. Even though it might be possible to get AlDente to work on older MacBooks and macOS versions too, we are currently not working on it. &#xA;&lt;/details&gt; &#xA;&lt;details&gt; &#xA; &lt;summary&gt;IS ALDENTE OPEN SOURCE?&lt;/summary&gt; The first couple of versions of AlDente Classic until AlDente Classic 2.0 are open source. Later versions of AlDente Classic or AlDente Free/Pro are not open source anymore. &#xA;&lt;/details&gt; &#xA;&lt;details&gt; &#xA; &lt;summary&gt;ALDENTE DOES NOT WORK ANYMORE AFTER MACOS UPDATE!&lt;/summary&gt; Unfortunately, for a small amount of users, AlDente temporarily does not work after a macOS update. To get AlDente to work again, just reinstall AlDente completely and everything should work as expected again. If that did not help, try to shut down your MacBook completely and unplug the power brick for a couple of minutes. Afterward, restart your MacBook, plug it in, and everything should work again. &#xA;&lt;/details&gt; &#xA;&lt;details&gt; &#xA; &lt;summary&gt;DOES ALDENTE SUPPORT APPLE&#39;S FAST USER SWITCHING?&lt;/summary&gt; Yes, since AlDente 1.15, Apple&#39;s Fast User Switching is supported. Please follow this tutorial to get it to work properly: https://apphousekitchen.com/fast-user-switching-explanation-and-tutorial/ &#xA;&lt;/details&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Other tools used in this project:&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/beltex/SMCKit&#34;&gt;https://github.com/beltex/SMCKit&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sindresorhus/LaunchAtLogin&#34;&gt;https://github.com/sindresorhus/LaunchAtLogin&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/andreyvit/create-dmg&#34;&gt;https://github.com/andreyvit/create-dmg&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Disclaimer:&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;I do not take any responsibility for any sort of damage in result of using this tool! Although this had no negative side effects for me and thousands of others, AlDente still taps in some very low level system functions that are not meant to be tampered with.

This software is all about allowing you to run apps &amp;amp; games on your M1 device runnnig macOS 12.0 or newer.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;It does this by putting the applications through a wrapper which imitates an iPad. This allows the apps to perform very well and run natively, because the M1 chip is essentially a glorified mobile chip. Another advantage to the software is that you can insert and manipulate custom controls with your keyboard, which is not possible in alternative sideloading methods such as Sideloadly. These controls include all the essentials, from WASD, Camera movement, Left and Right clicks, and individual keymapping, similar to a popular Android emulator’s keymapping system called Bluestacks.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;While this software was originally created to allow you to run Genshin Impact on your M1 device, it grew to allow many more applications to run.

It records events from &lt;code&gt;URLSession&lt;/code&gt; or from frameworks that use it, such as &lt;code&gt;Alamofire&lt;/code&gt;, and displays them using &lt;code&gt;PulseUI&lt;/code&gt; views that you integrate directly into your app. This way Pulse console is available for everyone who has your test builds. You or your QA team can view the logs on the device and easily share them to attach to bug reports.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What Pulse is Not&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pulse &lt;strong&gt;is not&lt;/strong&gt; a network debugging proxy tool like Proxyman, Charles, or Wireshark. It &lt;em&gt;won&#39;t&lt;/em&gt; automatically intercept all network traffic coming from your app or device. And to view logs in realtime, you need to use &lt;code&gt;PulseUI.framework&lt;/code&gt; that you integrate into your app. The dedicated Pulse iOS and macOS also use &lt;code&gt;PulseUI.framework&lt;/code&gt; and are there to view logs manually shared from other devices.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pulse is easy to learn and use thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://kean.blog/pulse/home&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pulse Docs&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kean.blog/pulse/home&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1567433/115163600-eea0cc80-a077-11eb-8b86-3113a657816f.png&#34;&gt; &lt;/a&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Pulse Pro&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://kean.blog/pulse/guides/pulse-pro&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pulse Pro&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt; is a professional open-source macOS app that allows you to view logs in real-time. The app is designed to be flexible, expansive, and precise while using all the familiar macOS patterns. It makes it easy to navigate large log files with table and text modes, filters, scroller markers, an all-new network inspector, JSON filters, and more.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Dependencies&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/weichsel/ZIPFoundation/&#34;&gt;ZIPFoundation&lt;/a&gt; for archiving Pulse documents. It&#39;s included directly in the binary.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Minimum Requirements&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;PulseUI&lt;/strong&gt; views are available only on indicated platforms, but the framework can be installed in the app targeting the &lt;strong&gt;PulseCore&lt;/strong&gt; platforms – you just won&#39;t be able to use the views.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;table&gt; &#xA; &lt;thead&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;Pulse&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;Swift&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;Xcode&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;Platforms&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA; &lt;/thead&gt; &#xA; &lt;tbody&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;PulseCore 0.14.0&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Swift 5.3&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Xcode 12.0&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;iOS 11.0 / watchOS 6.0 / tvOS 11.0 / macOS 11.0&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;PulseUI 0.14.0&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Swift 5.3&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Xcode 12.0&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;iOS 13.0 / watchOS 7.0 / tvOS 13.0 / macOS 11.0&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA; &lt;/tbody&gt; &#xA;&lt;/table&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;License&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Pulse is available under the MIT license.

To create a regular banner (with scrolling labels) and show it, simply:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let banner = NotificationBanner(title: title, subtitle: subtitle, style: .success)&#xA;banner.show()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to create a banner which grows in height as needed and show it accordingly just use &lt;code&gt;GrowingNotificationBanner&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;NotificationBanner&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let banner = GrowingNotificationBanner(title: title, subtitle: subtitle, style: .success)&#xA;banner.show()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To create a status bar alert, simply:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let banner = StatusBarNotificationBanner(title: title, style: .success)&#xA;banner.show()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;By default, each banner will be displayed on the main application window. If you are wanting to show a banner below a navigation bar, simply show on the view controller that is within the navigation system:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;banner.show(on: viewController)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;By default, each banner will present from the top. If you are wanting to display from the bottom, simply:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;banner.show(bannerPosition: .bottom)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each of the show properties defined above can be mixed and matched to work flawlessly with eachother.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;By default, each banner will automatically dismiss after 5 seconds. To dismiss programatically, simply:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;banner.dismiss()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To show a banner infinitely until it is manually dismissed, simply:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;banner.autoDismiss = false&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;NotificationBanner has five prebuilt styles that you can choose from:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;public enum BannerStyle {&#xA;    case danger&#xA;    case info&#xA;    case customView&#xA;    case success&#xA;    case warning&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can override the predefined colors that NotificationBanner uses for any style by conforming to the &lt;code&gt;BannerColorsProtocol&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;public protocol BannerColorsProtocol {&#xA;    func color(for style: BannerStyle) -&amp;gt; UIColor&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Its as easy as creating a custom banner colors class:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;class CustomBannerColors: BannerColorsProtocol {&#xA;&#xA;    internal func color(for style: BannerStyle) -&amp;gt; UIColor {&#xA;        switch style {&#xA;            case .danger:&#x9;// Your custom .danger color&#xA;            case .info:&#x9;&#x9;// Your custom .info color&#xA;            case .customView:&#x9;// Your custom .customView color&#xA;            case .success:&#x9;// Your custom .success color&#xA;            case .warning:&#x9;// Your custom .warning color&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then passing in that class to any notification banner you create:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let banner = NotificationBanner(title: title, style: .success, colors: CustomBannerColors())&#xA;banner.show()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;By default, the &lt;code&gt;.info&lt;/code&gt; style will be applied to the banner if no style is provided in the init method. You can set the background color of a banner at any time by simply setting the &lt;code&gt;backgroundColor&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Banners with Side Views&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;A notification banner can have a left accessory view, a right accessory view, or both:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Success Style Notification with Left View&#xA;let leftView = UIImageView(image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: &#34;success&#34;))&#xA;let banner = NotificationBanner(title: title, subtitle: subtitle, leftView: leftView, style: .success)&#xA;banner.show()&#xA;&#xA; // Danger Style Notification with Right View&#xA;let rightView = UIImageView(image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: &#34;danger&#34;))&#xA;let banner = NotificationBanner(title: title, subtitle: subtitle, rightView: rightView, style: .danger)&#xA;banner.show()    &#xA;&#xA;// Info Style Notification with Left and Right Views&#xA;let leftView = UIImageView(image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: &#34;info&#34;))&#xA;let rightView = UIImageView(image: #imageLiteral(resourceName: &#34;right_chevron&#34;))&#xA;let banner = NotificationBanner(title: title, subtitle: subtitle, leftView: leftView, rightView: rightView, style: .info)&#xA;banner.show()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daltron/NotificationBanner/master/NotificationBanner/Assets/side_views.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Banners with Side Views&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each side view will be automically reisized to fit perfectly&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Banners with a Custom View&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;A notification banner can also be initalized with a custom view:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let banner = NotificationBanner(customView: NorthCarolinaBannerView())&#xA;banner.show()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daltron/NotificationBanner/master/NotificationBanner/Assets/custom.gif&#34; alt=&#34;Custom Banner&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Handling User Interaction&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;By default, when a banner is tapped or swiped up by a user, it will be dismissed. If you want to detect when the user taps or swipes up on a banner, simply:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;banner.onTap = {&#xA;&#x9;// Do something regarding the banner&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;banner.onSwipeUp = {&#xA;&#x9;// Do something regarding the banner&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Banner Events&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can choose to opt into a notification banner&#39;s events by registering as its delegate:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;banner.delegate = self&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then just make sure to implement the following methods:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;func notificationBannerWillAppear(_ banner: BaseNotificationBanner)&#xA;func notificationBannerDidAppear(_ banner: BaseNotificationBanner)&#xA;func notificationBannerWillDisappear(_ banner: BaseNotificationBanner)&#xA;func notificationBannerDidDisappear(_ banner: BaseNotificationBanner)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Haptic Feedback Support&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;By default, when a banner is displayed, a haptic feedback will be generated on devices that support it. The types of haptic feedback are as follows:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;public enum BannerHaptic {&#xA;&#x9;case light&#xA;   &#x9;case medium&#xA;&#x9;case heavy&#xA;  &#x9;case none&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To change the type of haptic feedback to generate when a banner is shown, simply:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;banner.haptic = .heavy&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Banner Queue&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;By default, each notification banner is placed onto a singleton of an auto-managed &lt;code&gt;NotificationBannerQueue&lt;/code&gt;. This allows an infinite amount of banners to be displayed without one hiding the other. If you have multiple controllers within your navigation stack that need to be managed by a seperate queue (like a tab bar controller), simply create an instance of a &lt;code&gt;NotificationBannerQueue&lt;/code&gt; and pass it in to the show function:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;banner.show(queue: customQueue)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;By default, each notification banner is placed on the back of the queue. If you would rather place the banner in the front and show it immediately no matter how many banners are in the queue, simply state it in the &lt;code&gt;show()&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;banner.show(queuePosition: .front)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Adding a banner to the front of the queue will temporarily suspend the currently displayed banner (if there is one) and will resume it after the banner in front of it dismisses.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get the number of banners currently on the queue, simply:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let numberOfBanners = NotificationBannerQueue.default.numberOfBanners&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;b&gt;This is all automatically managed!&lt;/b&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Banner Queue and display banners simultaneously (stacked)&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also create the queue to display several banners at once with controlling of maximum number of banners to be displayed simultaneously. You can &#34;show&#34; more banners than allowed by queue settings - banners what exceed this value will be displayed some time later, after some banners already displayed on screen will be closed. In example below we create queue with maximum simultaneous banners allowed - 3:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let bannerQueueToDisplaySeveralBanners = NotificationBannerQueue(maxBannersOnScreenSimultaneously: 3)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Create five different banners:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let banner1 = FloatingNotificationBanner(&#xA;&#x9;title: &#34;Success Notification - 1&#34;,&#xA;&#x9;subtitle: &#34;First Notification from 5 in current queue with 3 banners allowed simultaneously&#34;,&#xA;&#x9;style: .success&#xA;)&#xA;banner1.delegate = self&#xA;&#xA;let banner2 = FloatingNotificationBanner(&#xA;&#x9;title: &#34;Danger Notification - 2&#34;,&#xA;&#x9;subtitle: &#34;Second Notification from 5 in current queue with 3 banners allowed simultaneously&#34;,&#xA;&#x9;style: .danger&#xA;)&#xA;banner2.delegate = self&#xA;&#xA;let banner3 = FloatingNotificationBanner(&#xA;&#x9;title: &#34;Info Notification - 3&#34;,&#xA;&#x9;subtitle: &#34;Third Notification from 5 in current queue with 3 banners allowed simultaneously&#34;,&#xA;&#x9;style: .info&#xA;)&#xA;banner3.delegate = self&#xA;&#xA;let banner4 = FloatingNotificationBanner(&#xA;&#x9;title: &#34;Success Notification - 4&#34;,&#xA;&#x9;subtitle: &#34;Fourth Notification from 5 in current queue with 3 banners allowed simultaneously&#34;,&#xA;&#x9;style: .success&#xA;)&#xA;banner4.delegate = self&#xA;&#xA;let banner5 = FloatingNotificationBanner(&#xA;&#x9;title: &#34;Info Notification - 5&#34;,&#xA;&#x9;subtitle: &#34;Fifth Notification from 5 in current queue with 3 banners allowed simultaneously&#34;,&#xA;&#x9;style: .info&#xA;)&#xA;banner5.delegate = self&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;and show all five banners at once:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;showBanners(&#xA;&#x9;[banner1, banner2, banner3, banner4, banner5],&#xA;&#x9;in: bannerQueue5AllowedMixed&#xA;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;using this supporting method&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;func showBanners(&#xA;&#x9;_ banners: [FloatingNotificationBanner],&#xA;&#x9;in notificationBannerQueue: NotificationBannerQueue&#xA;) {&#xA;    banners.forEach { banner in&#xA;      &#x9;banner.show(&#xA;&#x9;      &#x9;bannerPosition: selectedBannerPosition(),&#xA;&#x9;&#x9; &#x9;queue: notificationBannerQueue,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9; &#x9;cornerRadius: 8,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;shadowColor: UIColor(red: 0.431, green: 0.459, blue: 0.494, alpha: 1),&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;  &#x9;shadowBlurRadius: 16,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;&#x9;shadowEdgeInsets: UIEdgeInsets(top: 8, left: 8, bottom: 0, right: 8)&#xA;&#x9;   )&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;It will display first three banners at once, and after some time (or by user tap) it will be hidden and 4 and 5 banner will be displayed when. All it with fancy animation.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Feature Requests&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;I&#39;d love to know anything that you think NotificationBanner is missing. Open an issue and I&#39;ll add the &lt;code&gt;feature request&lt;/code&gt; label to it and I&#39;ll do everything I can to accomodate that request if it is in the library&#39;s best interest. 😄&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Apps that Use NotificationBanner&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/q-talk-about-music/id1071551321?mt=8&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daltron/NotificationBanner/master/AppIcons/q_talk_about_music.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Q - Talk About Music&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/app/vh-dispatch/id1249569084&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daltron/NotificationBanner/master/AppIcons/vh_dispatch.png&#34; alt=&#34;VH Dispatch&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/app/stikkr/id851375015&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daltron/NotificationBanner/master/AppIcons/stikkr.png&#34; alt=&#34;Stikkr&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/app/cardcast-business-cards/id1269278947&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daltron/NotificationBanner/master/AppIcons/cardcast.png&#34; alt=&#34;CardCast&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/app/happy-scale/id532430574&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daltron/NotificationBanner/master/AppIcons/happy_scale.png&#34; alt=&#34;Happy Scale&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/app/wanderings-travel-tracking/id1292503352&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daltron/NotificationBanner/master/AppIcons/wanderings.png&#34; alt=&#34;Wanderings&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/app/modern-magic-8-ball/id1381145384&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daltron/NotificationBanner/master/AppIcons/modernmagic8ball.png&#34; alt=&#34;Modern Magic 8 Ball&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/app/envision-habits-tracker/id1423771095&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daltron/NotificationBanner/master/AppIcons/envision.png&#34; alt=&#34;Envision: Habits Tracker&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/%D1%86%D1%83%D0%BC-%D0%B8%D0%BD%D1%82%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%BD%D0%B5%D1%82-%D0%BC%D0%B0%D0%B3%D0%B0%D0%B7%D0%B8%D0%BD-%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B5%D0%B6%D0%B4%D1%8B/id1089560311&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daltron/NotificationBanner/master/AppIcons/tsum.png&#34; alt=&#34;TSUM&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/%D1%80%D0%B5%D1%81%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D0%BD%D1%8B-%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%81-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B7-%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0/id932844115&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daltron/NotificationBanner/master/AppIcons/ris.png&#34; alt=&#34;RIS&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://apps.apple.com/ru/app/luka-pizza-%D0%B7%D0%B0%D0%BA%D0%B0%D0%B7-%D0%B8-%D0%B4%D0%BE%D1%81%D1%82%D0%B0%D0%B2%D0%BA%D0%B0/id1202155629&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Daltron/NotificationBanner/master/AppIcons/lukapizza.png&#34; alt=&#34;LukaPizza&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Feel free to add yours!&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Author&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Dalton Hinterscher, &lt;a href=&#34;mailto:daltonhint4@gmail.com&#34;&gt;daltonhint4@gmail.com&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;License&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;NotificationBanner is available under the MIT license.

It extends the language abstractions to allow you to generate boilerplate code automatically.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;It&#39;s used in over 40,000 projects on both iOS and macOS and it powers some of the most popular and critically-acclaimed apps you have used (including Airbnb, Bumble, New York Times). Its massive community adoption was one of the factors that pushed Apple to implement derived Equality and automatic Codable conformance. Sourcery is maintained by a growing community of &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/graphs/contributors&#34;&gt;contributors&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Try &lt;strong&gt;Sourcery&lt;/strong&gt; for your next project or add it to an existing one -- you&#39;ll save a lot of time and be happy you did!&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;TL;DR&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sourcery allows you to get rid of repetitive code and create better architecture and developer workflows. An example might be implementing &lt;code&gt;Mocks&lt;/code&gt; for all your protocols, without Sourcery you will need to write &lt;strong&gt;hundreds lines of code per each protocol&lt;/strong&gt; like this:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;class MyProtocolMock: MyProtocol {&#xA;&#xA;    //MARK: - sayHelloWith&#xA;    var sayHelloWithNameCallsCount = 0&#xA;    var sayHelloWithNameCalled: Bool {&#xA;        return sayHelloWithNameCallsCount &amp;gt; 0&#xA;    }&#xA;    var sayHelloWithNameReceivedName: String?&#xA;    var sayHelloWithNameReceivedInvocations: [String] = []&#xA;    var sayHelloWithNameClosure: ((String) -&amp;gt; Void)?&#xA;&#xA;    func sayHelloWith(name: String) {&#xA;        sayHelloWithNameCallsCount += 1&#xA;        sayHelloWithNameReceivedName = name&#xA;        sayHelloWithNameReceivedInvocations.append(name)&#xA;        sayHelloWithNameClosure?(name)&#xA;    }&#xA;&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;and with Sourcery ?&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;extension MyProtocol: AutoMockable {}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sourcery removes the need to write any of the mocks code, how many protocol do you have in your project? Imagine how much time you&#39;ll save, using Sourcery will also make every single mock consistent and if you refactor or add properties, the mock code will be automatically updated for you, eliminating possible human errors.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sourcery can be applied to arbitrary problems across your codebase, if you can describe an algorithm to another human, you can automate it using Sourcery.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most common uses are:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://merowing.info/Sourcery/equatable.html&#34;&gt;Equality&lt;/a&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;a href=&#34;https://merowing.info/Sourcery/hashable.html&#34;&gt;Hashing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://merowing.info/Sourcery/enum-cases.html&#34;&gt;Enum cases &amp;amp; Counts&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://merowing.info/Sourcery/lenses.html&#34;&gt;Lenses&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://merowing.info/Sourcery/mocks.html&#34;&gt;Mocks &amp;amp; Stubs&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://merowing.info/Sourcery/linuxmain.html&#34;&gt;LinuxMain&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://merowing.info/Sourcery/decorator.html&#34;&gt;Decorators&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://merowing.info/Sourcery/codable.html&#34;&gt;Persistence and advanced Codable&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://merowing.info/Sourcery/diffable.html&#34;&gt;Property level diffing&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;But how about more specific use-cases, like automatically generating all the UI for your app &lt;code&gt;BetaSetting&lt;/code&gt;? &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/AutomaticSettings&#34;&gt;you can use Sourcery for that too&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you start writing your own template and learn the power of Sourcery you won&#39;t be able to live without it.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;How To Get Started&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are plenty of tutorials for different uses of Sourcery, and you can always ask for help in our &lt;a href=&#34;https://forums.swift.org/c/related-projects/sourcery&#34;&gt;Swift Forum Category&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.caseyliss.com/2017/3/31/the-magic-of-sourcery&#34;&gt;The Magic of Sourcery&lt;/a&gt; is a great starting tutorial&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://www.raywenderlich.com/158803/sourcery-tutorial-generating-swift-code-ios&#34;&gt;Generating Swift Code for iOS&lt;/a&gt; deals with JSON handling code&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://atomicrobot.io/blog/sourcery/&#34;&gt;How To Automate Swift Boilerplate with Sourcery&lt;/a&gt; generates conversions to dictionaries&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://littlebitesofcocoa.com/318-codable-enums&#34;&gt;Codable Enums&lt;/a&gt; implements Codable support for Enumerations&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/SourceryWorkshops&#34;&gt;Sourcery Workshops&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Quick Mocking Intro &amp;amp; Getting Started Video&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also watch this quick getting started and intro to mocking video by Inside iOS Dev: &lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://youtu.be/-ZbBNuttlt4?t=214&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/master/Resources/Inside-iOS-Dev-Sourcery-Intro-To-Mocking-Video-Thumbnail.png&#34; alt=&#34;Watch the video&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Binary form&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Download the latest release with the prebuilt binary from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/releases/latest&#34;&gt;release tab&lt;/a&gt;.

You can provide multiple paths using multiple &lt;code&gt;--sources&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--templates&lt;/code&gt; - Path to templates. File or Directory. You can provide multiple paths using multiple &lt;code&gt;--templates&lt;/code&gt; options.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--force-parse&lt;/code&gt; - File extensions of Sourcery generated file you want to parse. You can provide multiple extension using multiple &lt;code&gt;--force-parse&lt;/code&gt; options. (i.e. &lt;code&gt;file.toparse.swift&lt;/code&gt; will be parsed even if generated by Sourcery if &lt;code&gt;--force-parse toparse&lt;/code&gt;). Useful when trying to implement a multiple phases generation. &lt;code&gt;--force-parse&lt;/code&gt; can also be used to process within a sourcery annotation. For example to process code within &lt;code&gt;sourcery:inline:auto:Type.AutoCodable&lt;/code&gt; annotation you can use &lt;code&gt;--force-parse AutoCodable&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--output&lt;/code&gt; [default: current path] - Path to output. File or Directory.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--config&lt;/code&gt; [default: current path] - Path to config file. File or Directory. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/krzysztofzablocki/Sourcery/master/#configuration-file&#34;&gt;Configuration file&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--args&lt;/code&gt; - Additional arguments to pass to templates. Each argument can have an explicit value or will have implicit &lt;code&gt;true&lt;/code&gt; value. Arguments should be separated with &lt;code&gt;,&lt;/code&gt; without spaces (i.e. &lt;code&gt;--args arg1=value,arg2&lt;/code&gt;). Arguments are accessible in templates via &lt;code&gt;argument.name&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--watch&lt;/code&gt; [default: false] - Watch both code and template folders for changes and regenerate automatically.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--verbose&lt;/code&gt; [default: false] - Turn on verbose logging&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--quiet&lt;/code&gt; [default: false] - Turn off any logging, only emit errors&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--disableCache&lt;/code&gt; [default: false] - Turn off caching of parsed data&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--prune&lt;/code&gt; [default: false] - Prune empty generated files&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--version&lt;/code&gt; - Display the current version of Sourcery&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;--help&lt;/code&gt; - Display help information&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Configuration file&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of CLI arguments you can use a &lt;code&gt;.sourcery.yml&lt;/code&gt; configuration file:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-yaml&#34;&gt;sources:&#xA;  - &amp;lt;sources path&amp;gt;&#xA;  - &amp;lt;sources path&amp;gt;&#xA;templates:&#xA;  - &amp;lt;templates path&amp;gt;&#xA;  - &amp;lt;templates path&amp;gt;&#xA;force-parse:&#xA;  - &amp;lt;string value&amp;gt;&#xA;  - &amp;lt;string value&amp;gt;&#xA;output:&#xA;  &amp;lt;output path&amp;gt;&#xA;args:&#xA;  &amp;lt;name&amp;gt;: &amp;lt;value&amp;gt;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Read more about this configuration file &lt;a href=&#34;https://merowing.info/Sourcery/usage.html#configuration-file&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Issues&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you get unverified developer warning when using binary zip distribution try: &lt;code&gt;xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine Sourcery-1.1.1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Contributing&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Contributions to Sourcery are welcomed and encouraged!&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is easy to get involved.

It has no other dependencies.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;RxCocoa&lt;/strong&gt;: Provides Cocoa-specific capabilities for general iOS/macOS/watchOS &amp;amp; tvOS app development, such as Shared Sequences, Traits, and much more.

All you need is a Mac and a &lt;a href=&#34;https://microbit.org/&#34;&gt;BBC micro:bit&lt;/a&gt; or any &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/main/#how-to-track-other-bluetooth-devices&#34;&gt;other Bluetooth-capable device&lt;/a&gt;. By using the app, you can track your accessories anywhere on earth without cellular coverage. Nearby iPhones will discover your accessories and upload their location to Apple&#39;s servers when they have a network connection.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;History&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;OpenHaystack is the result of reverse-engineering and security analysis work of Apple&#39;s &lt;em&gt;Find My network&lt;/em&gt; (or &lt;em&gt;offline finding&lt;/em&gt;). We at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://seemoo.de&#34;&gt;Secure Mobile Networking Lab&lt;/a&gt; of TU Darmstadt started analyzing offline finding after its initial announcement in June 2019. We identified how Apple devices can be found by iPhones devices, even when they are offline through this work. The whole system is a clever combination of Bluetooth advertisements, public-key cryptography, and a central database of encrypted location reports. We disclosed a specification of the closed parts of offline finding and conducted a comprehensive security and privacy analysis. We found two distinct vulnerabilities. The most severe one, which allowed a malicious application to access location data, has meanwhile been fixed by Apple (&lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT211849&#34;&gt;CVE-2020-9986&lt;/a&gt;). For more information about the security analysis, please read &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/main/#references&#34;&gt;our paper&lt;/a&gt;. Since its release, we received quite a bit of &lt;a href=&#34;https://owlink.org/press/&#34;&gt;press and media coverage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Disclaimer&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;OpenHaystack is experimental software. The code is untested and incomplete. For example, OpenHaystack accessories using our &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/main/Firmware&#34;&gt;firmware&lt;/a&gt; broadcast a fixed public key and, therefore, are trackable by other devices in proximity (this might change in a future release). OpenHaystack is not affiliated with or endorsed by Apple Inc.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;How to use &lt;em&gt;OpenHaystack&lt;/em&gt;?&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;OpenHaystack consists of two components. First, we provide a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/main/OpenHaystack&#34;&gt;macOS application&lt;/a&gt; that can display the last reported location of your personal Bluetooth devices. Second, the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/main/Firmware&#34;&gt;firmware image&lt;/a&gt; enables Bluetooth devices to broadcast beacons that make them discoverable by iPhones.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;System requirements&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;OpenHaystack requires macOS 11 (Big Sur).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Installation&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The OpenHaystack application requires a custom plugin for Apple Mail. It is used to download location reports from Apple&#39;s servers via a private API (technical explanation: the plugin inherits Apple Mail&#39;s entitlements required to use this API). Therefore, the installation procedure is slightly different and requires you to temporarily disable &lt;a href=&#34;https://support.apple.com/guide/security/gatekeeper-and-runtime-protection-sec5599b66df/1/web/1&#34;&gt;Gatekeeper&lt;/a&gt;. Our plugin does not access any other private data such as emails (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/main/OpenHaystack/OpenHaystackMail&#34;&gt;source code&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Download a precompiled binary release from our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/releases&#34;&gt;GitHub page&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;br&gt; &lt;em&gt;Alternative:&lt;/em&gt; build the application from source via Xcode.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Open OpenHaystack. This will ask you to install the Mail plugin in &lt;code&gt;~/Library/Mail/Bundle&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Open a terminal and run &lt;code&gt;sudo spctl --master-disable&lt;/code&gt;, which will disable Gatekeeper and allow our Apple Mail plugin to run.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Open Apple Mail. Go to &lt;em&gt;Preferences&lt;/em&gt; → &lt;em&gt;General&lt;/em&gt; → &lt;em&gt;Manage Plug-Ins...&lt;/em&gt; and activate the checkbox next to &lt;em&gt;OpenHaystackMail.mailbundle&lt;/em&gt;. &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;If the &lt;em&gt;Manage Plug-Ins...&lt;/em&gt; button does not appear. Run this command in terminal &lt;code&gt;sudo defaults write &#34;/Library/Preferences/com.apple.mail&#34; EnableBundles 1&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Allow access and restart Mail.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Open a terminal and enter &lt;code&gt;sudo spctl --master-enable&lt;/code&gt;, which will enable Gatekeeper again.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Usage&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Adding a new accessory.&lt;/strong&gt; To create a new accessory, you just need to enter a name for it and optionally select a suitable icon and a color. The app then generates a new key pair that is used to encrypt and decrypt the location reports. The private key is stored in your Mac&#39;s keychain.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Deploy to device.&lt;/strong&gt; Connect a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/main/#how-to-track-other-bluetooth-devices&#34;&gt;supported device&lt;/a&gt; via USB to your Mac and hit the &lt;em&gt;Deploy&lt;/em&gt; button next to the accessory&#39;s name and choose the corresponding. Instead of using OpenHaystack&#39;s integrated deployment, you may also copy the public key used for advertising (right click on accessory) and deploy it manually.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Display devices&#39; locations.&lt;/strong&gt; It can take up to 30 minutes until you will see the first location report on the map on the right side. The map will always show all your items&#39; most recent locations. You can click on every item to check when the last update was received. By clicking the reload button, you can update the location reports.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;How does Apple&#39;s Find My network work?&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We briefly explain Apple&#39;s offline finding system (aka &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/find-my/&#34;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Find My network&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). Please refer to our &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/main/#references&#34;&gt;PETS paper and Apple&#39;s accessory specification&lt;/a&gt; for more details. We provide a schematic overview (from our paper) and explain how we integrate the different steps in OpenHaystack below.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/main/Resources/FindMyOverview.png&#34; alt=&#34;Find My Overview&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Pairing (1)&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To use Apple&#39;s Find My network, we generate a public-private key pair on an elliptic curve (P-224). The private key remains on the Mac securely stored in the keychain, and the public key is deployed on the accessory, e.g., an attached micro:bit.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Losing (2)&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In short, the accessories broadcast the public key as Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) advertisements (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/main/Firmware&#34;&gt;firmware&lt;/a&gt;). Nearby iPhones will not be able to distinguish our accessories from a genuine Apple device or certified accessory.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Finding (3)&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When a nearby iPhone receives a BLE advertisement, the iPhone fetches its current location via GPS, encrypts it using public key from the advertisement, and uploads the encrypted report to Apple&#39;s server. All iPhones on iOS 13 or newer do this by default. OpenHaystack is not involved in this step.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Searching (4)&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple does not know which encrypted locations belong to which Apple account or device. Therefore, every Apple user can download any location report as long as they know the corresponding public key. This is not a security issue: all reports are end-to-end encrypted and cannot be decrypted unless one knows the corresponding private key (stored in the keychain). We leverage this feature to download the reports from Apple that have been created for our OpenHaystack accessories. We use our private keys to decrypt the location reports and show the most recent one on the map.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Apple protects their database against arbitrary access by requiring an authenticated Apple user to download location reports. We use our Apple Mail plugin, which runs with elevated privileges, to access the required authentication information. The OpenHaystack app communicates with the plugin while downloading reports. This is why you need to keep Mail open while using OpenHaystack.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;How to track other Bluetooth devices?&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In principle, any Bluetooth device can be turned into an OpenHaystack accessory that is trackable via Apple&#39;s Find My network. Currently, we provide a convenient deployment method of our OpenHaystack firmwares for a small number of embedded devices (see table below). We also support Linux devices via our generic HCI script. Feel free to port OpenHaystack to other devices that support Bluetooth Low Energy based on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/main/Firmware&#34;&gt;source code of our firmware&lt;/a&gt; and the specification in &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/main/#references&#34;&gt;our paper&lt;/a&gt;. Please share your results with us!&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;table&gt; &#xA; &lt;thead&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;Platform&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;Tested on&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;Deploy via app&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;Comment&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA; &lt;/thead&gt; &#xA; &lt;tbody&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/main/Firmware/Microbit_v1&#34;&gt;Nordic nRF51&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;BBC micro:bit v1&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;✓&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Only supports nRF51822 at this time (see issue #6).&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/main/Firmware/ESP32&#34;&gt;Espressif ESP32&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;SP32-WROOM, ESP32-WROVER&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;✓&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Deployment can take up to 3 minutes.

The app provides the same functionality to create and track accessories and aims to increase the usability, especially for new users. In contrast to the macOS application, the location reports cannot be fetched directly on the smartphone, so the app requires a proxy server hosted on Mac hardware to access the Find My network. The proxy server can be accessed over a network by multiple users simultaneously.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To connect to your proxy server set the correct URL in: openhaystack-mobile/lib/findMy/reports_fetcher.dart&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img width=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/main/Resources/mobile-map-view.png&#34;&gt; &lt;img width=&#34;300&#34; src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/seemoo-lab/openhaystack/main/Resources/mobile-accessory-history.png&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;OpenHaystack Mobile is built with the cross-platform &lt;a href=&#34;https://flutter.dev/&#34;&gt;Flutter framework&lt;/a&gt; and currently runs on Android and iOS.

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;FlowStacks allows you to hoist SwiftUI navigation and presentation state into a Coordinator&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;FlowStacks&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Coordinator pattern in SwiftUI&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FlowStacks&lt;/em&gt; allow you to manage complex SwiftUI navigation and presentation flows with a simple array. This makes it easy to hoist navigation state into a higher-level coordinator, allowing you to write isolated views that have zero knowledge of their context within the navigation flow of an app.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You might like this library if:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;✅ You want to be able support deeplinks into deeply nested navigation routes in your app.&lt;br&gt; ✅ You want to be able to easily reuse views within different navigation contexts.&lt;br&gt; ✅ You want to easily go back to the root screen or a specific screen in the navigation stack.&lt;br&gt; ✅ You want to use the coordinator pattern to keep navigation logic in a single place.&lt;br&gt; ✅ You want to break an app&#39;s navigation into multiple reusable coordinators and compose them together.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The library works by translating the array of screens into a hierarchy of nested NavigationLinks and presentation calls, so:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;🚫 It does not rely on UIKit at all.&lt;br&gt; 🚫 It does not use &lt;code&gt;AnyView&lt;/code&gt; to type-erase screens.&lt;br&gt; 🚫 It does not try to recreate NavigationView from scratch.&lt;br&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To begin, create an enum encompassing each of the screens your flow might contain, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;enum Screen {&#xA;  case home&#xA;  case numberList&#xA;  case numberDetail(Int)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;A coordinator view can then manage an array of &lt;code&gt;Route&amp;lt;Screen&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;s, representing a stack of these screens, each one either pushed or presented. In the body of the coordinator view, initialize a &lt;code&gt;Router&lt;/code&gt; with a binding to the routes array, and a &lt;code&gt;ViewBuilder&lt;/code&gt; closure. The closure builds a view for a given screen, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct AppCoordinator: View {&#xA;  @State var routes: Routes&amp;lt;Screen&amp;gt; = [.root(.home)]&#xA;    &#xA;  var body: some View {&#xA;    Router($routes) { screen, _ in&#xA;      switch screen {&#xA;      case .home:&#xA;        HomeView(onGoTapped: showNumberList)&#xA;      case .numberList:&#xA;        NumberListView(onNumberSelected: showNumber, cancel: goBack)&#xA;      case .numberDetail(let number):&#xA;        NumberDetailView(number: number, cancel: goBackToRoot)&#xA;      }&#xA;    }&#xA;  }&#xA;    &#xA;  private func showNumberList() {&#xA;    routes.presentSheet(.numberList, embedInNavigationView: true)&#xA;  }&#xA;    &#xA;  private func showNumber(_ number: Int) {&#xA;    routes.push(.numberDetail(number))&#xA;  }&#xA;    &#xA;  private func goBack() {&#xA;    routes.goBack()&#xA;  }&#xA;    &#xA;  private func goBackToRoot() {&#xA;    routes.goBackToRoot()&#xA;  }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Convenience methods&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The routes array can be managed using normal Array methods, but a number of convenience methods are available for common transformations, such as:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;table&gt; &#xA; &lt;thead&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;Method&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;Effect&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA; &lt;/thead&gt; &#xA; &lt;tbody&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;push&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Pushes a new screen onto the stack.&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;presentSheet&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Presents a new screen as a sheet.†&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;presentCover&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Presents a new screen as a full-screen cover.†&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;goBack&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Goes back one screen in the stack.&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;goBackToRoot&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Goes back to the very first screen in the stack.&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;goBackTo&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Goes back to a specific screen in the stack.&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;pop&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Pops the current screen if it was pushed.&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;dismiss&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Dismisses the most recently presented screen.&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA; &lt;/tbody&gt; &#xA;&lt;/table&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;† &lt;em&gt;Pass &lt;code&gt;embedInNavigationView: true&lt;/code&gt; if you want to be able to push screens from the presented screen.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Routes array automatically updated&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the user taps the back button, the routes array will be automatically updated to reflect the new navigation state. Navigating back with an edge swipe gesture or via a long-press gesture on the back button will also update the routes array automatically, as will swiping to dismiss a sheet.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Bindings&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Router can be configured to work with a binding to the screen state, rather than just a read-only value - just add &lt;code&gt;$&lt;/code&gt; before the screen argument in the view-builder closure. The screen itself can then be responsible for updating its state within the routes array. Normally an enum is used to represent the screen, so it might be necessary to further extract the associated value for a particular screen as a binding. You can do that using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/pointfreeco/swiftui-navigation&#34;&gt;SwiftUINavigation&lt;/a&gt; library, which includes a number of helpful Binding transformations for optional and enum state, e.g.:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;import SwiftUINavigation&#xA;&#xA;struct BindingExampleCoordinator: View {&#xA;  enum Screen {&#xA;    case start&#xA;    case number(Int)&#xA;  }&#xA;  &#xA;  @State var routes: Routes&amp;lt;Screen&amp;gt; = [.root(.start, embedInNavigationView: true)]&#xA;    &#xA;  var body: some View {&#xA;    Router($routes) { $screen, _ in&#xA;      if let number = Binding(unwrapping: $screen, case: /Screen.number) {&#xA;        // Here number is a Binding&amp;lt;Int&amp;gt;, so EditableNumberView can change its&#xA;        // value in the routes array.&#xA;        EditableNumberView(number: number)&#xA;      } else {&#xA;        StartView(goTapped: goTapped)&#xA;      }&#xA;    }&#xA;  }&#xA;  &#xA;  func goTapped() {&#xA;    routes.push(.number(42))&#xA;  }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Child coordinators&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Coordinators are just views themselves, so they can be presented, pushed, added to a &lt;code&gt;TabView&lt;/code&gt; or a &lt;code&gt;WindowGroup&lt;/code&gt;, and can be configured in all the normal ways views can. They can even be pushed onto a parent coordinator&#39;s navigation stack, allowing you to break out parts of your navigation flow into separate child coordinators. When doing so, it is best that the child coordinator is always at the top of the parent&#39;s routes stack, as it will take over responsibility for pushing and presenting new screens. Otherwise, the parent might attempt to push screen(s) when the child is already pushing screen(s), causing a conflict.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Using View Models&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Using &lt;code&gt;Router&lt;/code&gt;s in the coordinator pattern also works well when using View Models. In these cases, the navigation state can live in the coordinator&#39;s own view model, and the Screen enum can include each screen&#39;s view model. With view models, the first example above can be re-written:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;enum Screen {&#xA;  case home(HomeViewModel)&#xA;  case numberList(NumberListViewModel)&#xA;  case numberDetail(NumberDetailViewModel)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;class AppCoordinatorViewModel: ObservableObject {&#xA;  @Published var routes: Routes&amp;lt;Screen&amp;gt;&#xA;    &#xA;  init() {&#xA;    self.routes = [.root(.home(.init(onGoTapped: showNumberList)))]&#xA;  }&#xA;    &#xA;  func showNumberList() {&#xA;    routes.presentSheet(.numberList(.init(onNumberSelected: showNumber, cancel: goBack)), embedInNavigationView: true)&#xA;  }&#xA;    &#xA;  func showNumber(_ number: Int) {&#xA;    routes.push(.numberDetail(.init(number: number, cancel: goBackToRoot)))&#xA;  }&#xA;    &#xA;  func goBack() {&#xA;    routes.goBack()&#xA;  }&#xA;    &#xA;  func goBackToRoot() {&#xA;    routes.goBackToRoot()&#xA;  }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;struct AppCoordinator: View {&#xA;  @ObservedObject var viewModel: AppCoordinatorViewModel&#xA;    &#xA;  var body: some View {&#xA;    Router($viewModel.routes) { screen in&#xA;      switch screen {&#xA;      case .home(let viewModel):&#xA;        HomeView(viewModel: viewModel)&#xA;      case .numberList(let viewModel):&#xA;        NumberListView(viewModel: viewModel)&#xA;      case .number(let viewModel):&#xA;        NumberView(viewModel: viewModel)&#xA;      }&#xA;    }&#xA;  }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Making complex navigation updates&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;SwiftUI does not allow more than one screen to be pushed, presented or dismissed within a single update. This makes it tricky to make large updates to the navigation state, e.g. when deeplinking straight to a view deep in the navigation hierarchy, when going back several presentation layers to the root, or when restoring arbitrary navigation state. With &lt;em&gt;FlowStacks&lt;/em&gt;, you can wrap such changes within a call to &lt;code&gt;withDelaysIfUnsupported&lt;/code&gt;, and the library will break down the large update into a series of smaller updates that SwiftUI supports:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;$routes.withDelaysIfUnsupported {&#xA;  $0.goBackToRoot()&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Or, if using a view model:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;RouteSteps.withDelaysIfUnsupported(self, \.routes) {&#xA;  $0.push(...)&#xA;  $0.push(...)&#xA;  $0.presentSheet(...)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Fixed root screen&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Often the root screen in a screen flow is static - always the same screen is in the root position. In this case you can use the &lt;code&gt;showing&lt;/code&gt; function on the root screen view to simplify matters. It takes the same parameters as the &lt;code&gt;Router&lt;/code&gt; initializer:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct ShowingCoordinator: View {&#xA;  enum Screen {&#xA;    case detail, edit, confirm&#xA;  }&#xA;  &#xA;  @State var routes: Routes&amp;lt;Screen&amp;gt; = []&#xA;  &#xA;  var body: some View {&#xA;    HomeView(onGoTapped: { routes.presentSheet(.detail) })&#xA;      .showing($routes) { $number, index in&#xA;        ...&#xA;      }&#xA;  }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;How does it work?&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This &lt;a href=&#34;https://johnpatrickmorgan.github.io/2021/07/03/NStack/&#34;&gt;blog post&lt;/a&gt; outlines how an array of screens can be translated into a hierarchy of views and &lt;code&gt;NavigationLink&lt;/code&gt;s. &lt;code&gt;Router&lt;/code&gt; uses a similar approach to allow both navigation and presentation.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Caveats&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Currently only the &lt;code&gt;.stack&lt;/code&gt; navigation view style is supported. There are some unexpected behaviours with the &lt;code&gt;.column&lt;/code&gt; navigation view style that make it problematic for the approach used in this library.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Be careful that your screens do not inadvertently end up observing the navigation state, e.g. if you were to pass a coordinator object to its screens as an &lt;code&gt;ObservableObject&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;EnvironmentObject&lt;/code&gt;. Not only would that cause your screens to be re-rendered unnecessarily whenever the navigation state changes, it can also cause SwiftUI&#39;s navigation state to deviate from your app&#39;s state.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Using The Composable Architecture?&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/johnpatrickmorgan/TCACoordinators&#34;&gt;TCACoordinators&lt;/a&gt; which uses FlowStacks to help navigation in TCA.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note on Carthage: R.swift is a tool used in a build step, it is not a dynamic library. Therefore &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift/issues/42&#34;&gt;it is not possible&lt;/a&gt; to install it with Carthage.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;CocoaPods (recommended)&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;pod &#39;R.swift&#39;&lt;/code&gt; to your &lt;a href=&#34;http://cocoapods.org/#get_started&#34;&gt;Podfile&lt;/a&gt; and run &lt;code&gt;pod install&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;In Xcode: Click on your project in the file list, choose your target under &lt;code&gt;TARGETS&lt;/code&gt;, click the &lt;code&gt;Build Phases&lt;/code&gt; tab and add a &lt;code&gt;New Run Script Phase&lt;/code&gt; by clicking the little plus icon in the top left&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Drag the new &lt;code&gt;Run Script&lt;/code&gt; phase &lt;strong&gt;above&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;code&gt;Compile Sources&lt;/code&gt; phase and &lt;strong&gt;below&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;Check Pods Manifest.lock&lt;/code&gt;, expand it and paste the following script: &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;&#34;$PODS_ROOT/R.swift/rswift&#34; generate &#34;$SRCROOT/R.generated.swift&#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;$SRCROOT/R.generated.swift&lt;/code&gt; to the &#34;Output Files&#34; of the Build Phase&lt;/li&gt;

and run &lt;code&gt;mint bootstrap&lt;/code&gt; to install this package without linking it globally (recommended)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;In Xcode: Click on your project in the file list, choose your target under &lt;code&gt;TARGETS&lt;/code&gt;, click the &lt;code&gt;Build Phases&lt;/code&gt; tab and add a &lt;code&gt;New Run Script Phase&lt;/code&gt; by clicking the little plus icon in the top left&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Drag the new &lt;code&gt;Run Script&lt;/code&gt; phase &lt;strong&gt;above&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;code&gt;Compile Sources&lt;/code&gt; phase, expand it and paste the following script: &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;if mint list | grep -q &#39;R.swift&#39;; then&#xA;  mint run R.swift rswift generate &#34;$SRCROOT/R.generated.swift&#34;&#xA;else&#xA;

&#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tip:&lt;/em&gt; Add the &lt;code&gt;*.generated.swift&lt;/code&gt; pattern to your &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file to prevent unnecessary conflicts.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Second, Install &lt;code&gt;R.Swift.Library&lt;/code&gt; via the Swift Package Manager (requires Xcode 11)&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you see a build error &lt;code&gt;No such module &#39;Rswift&#39;&lt;/code&gt; when trying to &lt;code&gt;#import Rswift&lt;/code&gt; at the top of the &lt;code&gt;R.generated.swift&lt;/code&gt; file, then you will also need to install the &lt;em&gt;library&lt;/em&gt; via the Swift Package Manager available in Xcode 11+.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Head over to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift.Library&#34;&gt;R.Swift.Library&lt;/a&gt; repo and follow the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift.Library#swift-package-manager-requires-xcode-11&#34;&gt;Swift Package Manager installation instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://brew.sh&#34;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;R.swift is also available through &lt;a href=&#34;http://brew.sh&#34;&gt;Homebrew&lt;/a&gt;. This makes it possible to install R.swift globally on your system. Install R.swift by running: &lt;code&gt;brew install rswift&lt;/code&gt;. The Homebrew formula is maintained by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tomasharkema&#34;&gt;@tomasharkema&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Manually&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;0&#34;&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Add the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift.Library#Installation&#34;&gt;R.swift.Library&lt;/a&gt; to your project&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift/releases&#34;&gt;Download&lt;/a&gt; a R.swift release, unzip it and put it into your source root directory&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;In Xcode: Click on your project in the file list, choose your target under &lt;code&gt;TARGETS&lt;/code&gt;, click the &lt;code&gt;Build Phases&lt;/code&gt; tab and add a &lt;code&gt;New Run Script Phase&lt;/code&gt; by clicking the little plus icon in the top left&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Drag the new &lt;code&gt;Run Script&lt;/code&gt; phase &lt;strong&gt;above&lt;/strong&gt; the &lt;code&gt;Compile Sources&lt;/code&gt; phase, expand it and paste the following script: &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;&#34;$SRCROOT/rswift&#34; generate &#34;$SRCROOT/R.generated.swift&#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Add &lt;code&gt;$SRCROOT/R.generated.swift&lt;/code&gt; to the &#34;Output Files&#34; of the Build Phase&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Uncheck &#34;Based on dependency analysis&#34; so that R.swift is run on each build&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Build your project, in Finder you will now see a &lt;code&gt;R.generated.swift&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;$SRCROOT&lt;/code&gt;-folder, drag the &lt;code&gt;R.generated.swift&lt;/code&gt; files into your project and &lt;strong&gt;uncheck&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;code&gt;Copy items if needed&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Screenshot of the Build Phase can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mac-cain13/R.swift/master/Documentation/Images/ManualBuildPhaseExample.png&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Tip:&lt;/em&gt; Add the &lt;code&gt;*.generated.swift&lt;/code&gt; pattern to your &lt;code&gt;.gitignore&lt;/code&gt; file to prevent unnecessary conflicts.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Building from source&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;R.swift is built using &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apple/swift-package-manager&#34;&gt;Swift Package Manager (SPM)&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Check out the code&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;swift build -c release&lt;/code&gt; from the root directory&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Follow the manual installation steps with the binary you now have&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For developing on R.swift in Xcode, run &lt;code&gt;swift package generate-xcodeproj --xcconfig-overrides RswiftConfig.xcconfig&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Contribute&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&#39;ll love contributions, read the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mac-cain13/R.swift/master/Documentation/Contribute.md&#34;&gt;contribute docs&lt;/a&gt; for info on how to report issues, submit ideas and submit pull requests!&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;License&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift&#34;&gt;R.swift&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mac-cain13/R.swift.Library&#34;&gt;R.swift.Library&lt;/a&gt; are created by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mac-cain13&#34;&gt;Mathijs Kadijk&lt;/a&gt; and released under a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mac-cain13/R.swift/master/License&#34;&gt;MIT License&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Special thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/tomlokhorst&#34;&gt;Tom Lokhorst&lt;/a&gt; for his major contributions and help maintaining this project.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

To build IINA, you can either fetch copies of these libraries we have already built (using the instructions below) or build them yourself by skipping to &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/iina/iina/develop/#building-mpv-manually&#34;&gt;these instructions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Using the pre-compiled libraries&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Download pre-compiled libraries by running&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;./other/download_libs.sh&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Tips: &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;Change URL in the shell script if you want to download arch-specific binaries. By default, it will download the universal ones. You can download other binaries from &lt;code&gt;https://iina.io/dylibs/${ARCH}/fileList.txt&lt;/code&gt; where &lt;code&gt;ARCH&lt;/code&gt; can be &lt;code&gt;universal&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;arm64&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;x86_64&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;If you want to build an older IINA version, make sure to download the correponding dylibs. For example, &lt;code&gt;https://iina.io/dylibs/1.2.0/universal/fileList.txt&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol start=&#34;2&#34;&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Open iina.xcodeproj in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835&#34;&gt;latest public version of Xcode&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;IINA may not build if you use any other version.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Build the project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Building mpv manually&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Build your own copy of mpv. If you&#39;re using a package manager to manage dependencies, the steps below outline the process.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;With Homebrew&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use our tap as it passes in the correct flags to mpv&#39;s configure script:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;$ brew tap iina/homebrew-mpv-iina&#xA;$ brew install mpv-iina&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h4&gt;With MacPorts&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;p&gt;Pass in these flags when installing:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;# port install mpv +uchardet -bundle -rubberband configure.args=&#34;--enable-libmpv-shared --enable-lua --enable-libarchive --enable-libbluray --disable-swift --disable-rubberband&#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Copy the correponding mpv and FFmpeg header files into &lt;code&gt;deps/include/&lt;/code&gt;, replacing the current ones. You can find them on GitHub &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv/tree/master/libmpv&#34;&gt;(e.g. mpv)&lt;/a&gt;, but it&#39;s recommended to copy them from the Homebrew or MacPorts installation. Always make sure the header files have the same version of the dylibs.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;other/parse_doc.rb&lt;/code&gt;. This script will fetch the latest mpv documentation and generate &lt;code&gt;MPVOption.swift&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;MPVCommand.swift&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;MPVProperty.swift&lt;/code&gt;. Copy them from &lt;code&gt;other/&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;iina/&lt;/code&gt;, replacing the current files. This is only needed when updating libmpv. Note that if the API changes, the player source code may also need to be changed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Run &lt;code&gt;other/change_lib_dependencies.rb&lt;/code&gt;. This script will deploy the dependent libraries into &lt;code&gt;deps/lib&lt;/code&gt;. If you&#39;re using a package manager to manage dependencies, invoke it like so:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;h4&gt;With Homebrew&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;$ other/change_lib_dependencies.rb &#34;$(brew --prefix)&#34; &#34;$(brew --prefix mpv-iina)/lib/libmpv.dylib&#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;h4&gt;With MacPorts&lt;/h4&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-console&#34;&gt;$ port contents mpv | grep &#39;\.dylib$&#39; | xargs other/change_lib_dependencies.rb /opt/local&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Open iina.xcodeproj in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835&#34;&gt;latest public version of Xcode&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;em&gt;IINA may not build if you use any other version.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Remove all of references to .dylib files from the Frameworks group in the sidebar and add all the .dylib files in &lt;code&gt;deps/lib&lt;/code&gt; to that group by clicking &#34;Add Files to iina...&#34; in the context menu.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Add all the imported .dylib files into the &#34;Copy Dylibs&#34; phase under &#34;Build Phases&#34; tab of the iina target.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Make sure the necessary .dylib files present in the &#34;Link Binary With Libraries&#34; phase under &#34;Build Phases&#34;. Xcode should already added all dylibs under this section.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Build the project.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Contributing&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;IINA is always looking for contributions, whether it&#39;s through bug reports, code, or new translations.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;If you find a bug in IINA, or would like to suggest a new feature or enhancement, it&#39;d be nice if you could &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/iina/iina/issues&#34;&gt;search your problem first&lt;/a&gt;; while we don&#39;t mind duplicates, keeping issues unique helps us save time and consolidates effort.

You probably use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire&#34;&gt;Alamofire&lt;/a&gt; to abstract away access to &lt;code&gt;URLSession&lt;/code&gt; and all those nasty details you don&#39;t really care about. But then, like lots of smart developers, you write ad hoc network abstraction layers. They are probably called &#34;APIManager&#34; or &#34;NetworkModel&#34;, and they always end in tears.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Moya/Moya/master/web/diagram.png&#34; alt=&#34;Moya Overview&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Ad hoc network layers are common in iOS apps. They&#39;re bad for a few reasons:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Makes it hard to write new apps (&#34;where do I begin?&#34;)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Makes it hard to maintain existing apps (&#34;oh my god, this mess...&#34;)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Makes it hard to write unit tests (&#34;how do I do this again?&#34;)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;So the basic idea of Moya is that we want some network abstraction layer that sufficiently encapsulates actually calling Alamofire directly. It should be simple enough that common things are easy, but comprehensive enough that complicated things are also easy.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;If you use Alamofire to abstract away &lt;code&gt;URLSession&lt;/code&gt;, why not use something to abstract away the nitty gritty of URLs, parameters, etc?&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some awesome features of Moya:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Compile-time checking for correct API endpoint accesses.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Lets you define a clear usage of different endpoints with associated enum values.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Treats test stubs as first-class citizens so unit testing is super-easy.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can check out more about the project direction in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Moya/Moya/raw/master/Vision.md&#34;&gt;vision document&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Sample Projects&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have provided two sample projects in the repository. To use it download the repo, run &lt;code&gt;carthage update&lt;/code&gt; to download the required libraries and open &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Moya/Moya/tree/master/Moya.xcodeproj&#34;&gt;Moya.xcodeproj&lt;/a&gt;. You&#39;ll see two schemes: &lt;code&gt;Basic&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Multi-Target&lt;/code&gt; - select one and then build &amp;amp; run! Source files for these are in the &lt;code&gt;Examples&lt;/code&gt; directory in project navigator. Have fun!&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Project Status&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This project is actively under development, and is being used in &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Artsy/eidolon&#34;&gt;Artsy&#39;s auction app&lt;/a&gt;. We consider it ready for production use.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Moya version vs Swift version.&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Below is a table that shows which version of Moya you should use for your Swift version.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;table&gt; &#xA; &lt;thead&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;Swift&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;Moya&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;RxMoya&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;ReactiveMoya&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA; &lt;/thead&gt; &#xA; &lt;tbody&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;5.X&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&amp;gt;= 13.0.0&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&amp;gt;= 13.0.0&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&amp;gt;= 13.0.0&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;4.X&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;9.0.0 - 12.0.1&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;10.0.0 - 12.0.1&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;9.0.0 - 12.0.1&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;3.X&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;8.0.0 - 8.0.5&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;8.0.0 - 8.0.5&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;8.0.0 - 8.0.5&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;2.3&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;7.0.2 - 7.0.4&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;7.0.2 - 7.0.4&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;7.0.2 - 7.0.4&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;2.2&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;= 7.0.1&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;= 7.0.1&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;&amp;lt;= 7.0.1&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA; &lt;/tbody&gt; &#xA;&lt;/table&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: If you are using Swift 4.2 in your project, but you are using Xcode 10.2, Moya 13 should work correctly even though we use Swift 5.0.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Upgrading to a new major version of Moya? Check out our &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Moya/Moya/raw/master/docs/MigrationGuides&#34;&gt;migration guides&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Swift Package Manager&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Note: Instructions below are for using &lt;strong&gt;SwiftPM&lt;/strong&gt; without the Xcode UI. It&#39;s the easiest to go to your Project Settings -&amp;gt; Swift Packages and add Moya from there.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To integrate using Apple&#39;s Swift package manager, without Xcode integration, add the following as a dependency to your &lt;code&gt;Package.swift&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;.package(url: &#34;https://github.com/Moya/Moya.git&#34;, .upToNextMajor(from: &#34;15.0.0&#34;))&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;and then specify &lt;code&gt;&#34;Moya&#34;&lt;/code&gt; as a dependency of the Target in which you wish to use Moya. If you want to use reactive extensions, add also &lt;code&gt;&#34;ReactiveMoya&#34;&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&#34;RxMoya&#34;&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;&#34;CombineMoya&#34;&lt;/code&gt; as your target dependency respectively. Here&#39;s an example &lt;code&gt;PackageDescription&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// swift-tools-version:5.3&#xA;import PackageDescription&#xA;&#xA;let package = Package(&#xA;    name: &#34;MyPackage&#34;,&#xA;    products: [&#xA;        .library(&#xA;            name: &#34;MyPackage&#34;,&#xA;            targets: [&#34;MyPackage&#34;]),&#xA;    ],&#xA;    dependencies: [&#xA;        .package(url: &#34;https://github.com/Moya/Moya.git&#34;, .upToNextMajor(from: &#34;15.0.0&#34;))&#xA;    ],&#xA;    targets: [&#xA;        .target(&#xA;            name: &#34;MyPackage&#34;,&#xA;            dependencies: [&#34;ReactiveMoya&#34;])&#xA;    ]&#xA;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Combine note: if you&#39;re using &lt;strong&gt;CombineMoya&lt;/strong&gt;, make sure that you use Xcode 11.5.0 or later. With earlier versions of Xcode you will have to manually add Combine as a weakly linked framework to your application target.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Accio&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio&#34;&gt;Accio&lt;/a&gt; is a dependency manager based on SwiftPM which can build frameworks for iOS/macOS/tvOS/watchOS. Therefore the integration steps of Moya are exactly the same as described above. Once your &lt;code&gt;Package.swift&lt;/code&gt; file is configured, run &lt;code&gt;accio update&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;swift package update&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;CocoaPods&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For Moya, use the following entry in your Podfile:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-rb&#34;&gt;pod &#39;Moya&#39;, &#39;~&amp;gt; 15.0&#39;&#xA;&#xA;# or &#xA;&#xA;pod &#39;Moya/RxSwift&#39;, &#39;~&amp;gt; 15.0&#39;&#xA;&#xA;# or&#xA;&#xA;pod &#39;Moya/ReactiveSwift&#39;, &#39;~&amp;gt; 15.0&#39;&#xA;&#xA;# or&#xA;&#xA;pod &#39;Moya/Combine&#39;, &#39;~&amp;gt; 15.0&#39;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then run &lt;code&gt;pod install&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In any file you&#39;d like to use Moya in, don&#39;t forget to import the framework with &lt;code&gt;import Moya&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Carthage&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Carthage users can point to this repository and use whichever generated framework they&#39;d like, &lt;code&gt;Moya&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RxMoya&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;ReactiveMoya&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;CombineMoya&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make the following entry in your Cartfile:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;github &#34;Moya/Moya&#34; ~&amp;gt; 15.0&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then run &lt;code&gt;carthage update --use-xcframeworks&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this is your first time using Carthage in the project, you&#39;ll need to go through some additional steps as explained &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application&#34;&gt;over at Carthage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;NOTE: At this time, Carthage does not provide a way to build only specific repository submodules. All submodules and their dependencies will be built with the above command. However, you don&#39;t need to copy frameworks you aren&#39;t using into your project. For instance, if you aren&#39;t using &lt;code&gt;ReactiveSwift&lt;/code&gt;, feel free to delete that framework along with &lt;code&gt;ReactiveMoya&lt;/code&gt; from the Carthage Build directory after &lt;code&gt;carthage update&lt;/code&gt; completes. Or if you are using &lt;code&gt;ReactiveSwift&lt;/code&gt; but not &lt;code&gt;RxSwift&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Combine&lt;/code&gt;, then &lt;code&gt;RxMoya&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RxTest&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;RxCocoa&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;CombineMoya&lt;/code&gt; etc. can safely be deleted.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Manually&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Open up Terminal, &lt;code&gt;cd&lt;/code&gt; into your top-level project directory, and run the following command &lt;em&gt;if&lt;/em&gt; your project is not initialized as a git repository:&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;$ git init&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Add Alamofire &amp;amp; Moya as a git &lt;a href=&#34;http://git-scm.com/docs/git-submodule&#34;&gt;submodule&lt;/a&gt; by running the following commands:&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-bash&#34;&gt;$ git submodule add https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire.git&#xA;$ git submodule add https://github.com/Moya/Moya.git&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Open the new &lt;code&gt;Alamofire&lt;/code&gt; folder, and drag the &lt;code&gt;Alamofire.xcodeproj&lt;/code&gt; into the Project Navigator of your application&#39;s Xcode project. Do the same with the &lt;code&gt;Moya.xcodeproj&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;Moya&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;They should appear nested underneath your application&#39;s blue project icon. Whether it is above or below all the other Xcode groups does not matter.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Verify that the deployment targets of the &lt;code&gt;xcodeproj&lt;/code&gt;s match that of your application target in the Project Navigator.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Next, select your application project in the Project Navigator (blue project icon) to navigate to the target configuration window and select the application target under the &#34;Targets&#34; heading in the sidebar.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;In the tab bar at the top of that window, open the &#34;General&#34; panel.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Click on the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; button under the &#34;Embedded Binaries&#34; section.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;You will see two different &lt;code&gt;Alamofire.xcodeproj&lt;/code&gt; folders each with two different versions of the &lt;code&gt;Alamofire.framework&lt;/code&gt; nested inside a &lt;code&gt;Products&lt;/code&gt; folder.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;It does not matter which &lt;code&gt;Products&lt;/code&gt; folder you choose from, but it does matter whether you choose the top or bottom &lt;code&gt;Alamofire.framework&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Select the top &lt;code&gt;Alamofire.framework&lt;/code&gt; for iOS and the bottom one for macOS.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;You can verify which one you selected by inspecting the build log for your project. The build target for &lt;code&gt;Alamofire&lt;/code&gt; will be listed as either &lt;code&gt;Alamofire iOS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Alamofire macOS&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Alamofire tvOS&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Alamofire watchOS&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Click on the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; button under &#34;Embedded Binaries&#34; again and add the correct build target for &lt;code&gt;Moya&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;And that&#39;s it!&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;The three frameworks are automagically added as a target dependency, linked framework and embedded framework in a copy files build phase which is all you need to build on the simulator and a device.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;After &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Moya/Moya/raw/master/docs/Examples/Basic.md&#34;&gt;some setup&lt;/a&gt;, using Moya is really simple. You can access an API like this:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;provider = MoyaProvider&amp;lt;GitHub&amp;gt;()&#xA;provider.request(.zen) { result in&#xA;    switch result {&#xA;    case let .success(moyaResponse):&#xA;        let data = moyaResponse.data&#xA;        let statusCode = moyaResponse.statusCode&#xA;        // do something with the response data or statusCode&#xA;    case let .failure(error):&#xA;        // this means there was a network failure - either the request&#xA;        // wasn&#39;t sent (connectivity), or no response was received (server&#xA;        // timed out).  If the server responds with a 4xx or 5xx error, that&#xA;        // will be sent as a &#34;.success&#34;-ful response.&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;That&#39;s a basic example. Many API requests need parameters. Moya encodes these into the enum you use to access the endpoint, like this:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;provider = MoyaProvider&amp;lt;GitHub&amp;gt;()&#xA;provider.request(.userProfile(&#34;ashfurrow&#34;)) { result in&#xA;    // do something with the result&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;No more typos in URLs. No more missing parameter values. No more messing with parameter encoding.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more examples, see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Moya/Moya/raw/master/docs/Examples&#34;&gt;documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Reactive Extensions&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Even cooler are the reactive extensions. Moya provides reactive extensions for &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ReactiveCocoa/ReactiveSwift&#34;&gt;ReactiveSwift&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift&#34;&gt;RxSwift&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine&#34;&gt;Combine&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;ReactiveSwift&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Moya/Moya/raw/master/docs/ReactiveSwift.md&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ReactiveSwift&lt;/code&gt; extension&lt;/a&gt; provides both &lt;code&gt;reactive.request(:callbackQueue:)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;reactive.requestWithProgress(:callbackQueue:)&lt;/code&gt; methods that immediately return &lt;code&gt;SignalProducer&lt;/code&gt;s that you can start, bind, map, or whatever you want to do. To handle errors, for instance, we could do the following:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;provider = MoyaProvider&amp;lt;GitHub&amp;gt;()&#xA;provider.reactive.request(.userProfile(&#34;ashfurrow&#34;)).start { event in&#xA;    switch event {&#xA;    case let .value(response):&#xA;        image = UIImage(data: response.data)&#xA;    case let .failed(error):&#xA;        print(error)&#xA;    default:&#xA;        break&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;RxSwift&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Moya/Moya/raw/master/docs/RxSwift.md&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;RxSwift&lt;/code&gt; extension&lt;/a&gt; also provide both &lt;code&gt;rx.request(:callbackQueue:)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;rx.requestWithProgress(:callbackQueue:)&lt;/code&gt; methods, but return type is different for both. In case of a normal &lt;code&gt;rx.request(:callbackQueue)&lt;/code&gt;, the return type is &lt;code&gt;Single&amp;lt;Response&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which emits either single element or an error. In case of a &lt;code&gt;rx.requestWithProgress(:callbackQueue:)&lt;/code&gt;, the return type is &lt;code&gt;Observable&amp;lt;ProgressResponse&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, since we may get multiple events from progress and one last event which is a response.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To handle errors, for instance, we could do the following:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;provider = MoyaProvider&amp;lt;GitHub&amp;gt;()&#xA;provider.rx.request(.userProfile(&#34;ashfurrow&#34;)).subscribe { event in&#xA;    switch event {&#xA;    case let .success(response):&#xA;        image = UIImage(data: response.data)&#xA;    case let .error(error):&#xA;        print(error)&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In addition to the option of using signals instead of callback blocks, there are also a series of signal operators for RxSwift and ReactiveSwift that will attempt to map the data received from the network response into either an image, some JSON, or a string, with &lt;code&gt;mapImage()&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;mapJSON()&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;mapString()&lt;/code&gt;, respectively. If the mapping is unsuccessful, you&#39;ll get an error on the signal. You also get handy methods for filtering out certain status codes. This means that you can place your code for handling API errors like 400&#39;s in the same places as code for handling invalid responses.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Combine&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Combine&lt;/code&gt; extension provides &lt;code&gt;requestPublisher(:callbackQueue:)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;requestWithProgressPublisher(:callbackQueue)&lt;/code&gt; returning &lt;code&gt;AnyPublisher&amp;lt;Response, MoyaError&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;AnyPublisher&amp;lt;ProgressResponse, MoyaError&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; respectively.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here&#39;s an example of &lt;code&gt;requestPublisher&lt;/code&gt; usage:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;provider = MoyaProvider&amp;lt;GitHub&amp;gt;()&#xA;let cancellable = provider.requestPublisher(.userProfile(&#34;ashfurrow&#34;))&#xA;    .sink(receiveCompletion: { completion in&#xA;        guard case let .failure(error) = completion else { return }&#xA;&#xA;        print(error)&#xA;    }, receiveValue: { response in&#xA;        image = UIImage(data: response.data)&#xA;    })&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Community Projects&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Moya/Moya/raw/master/docs/CommunityProjects.md&#34;&gt;Moya has a great community around it and some people have created some very helpful extensions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Contributing&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hey!

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;SwiftPM package for SwiftSyntax library.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;SwiftSyntax&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;SwiftSyntax is a set of Swift bindings for the &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apple/swift/tree/main/lib/Syntax&#34;&gt;libSyntax&lt;/a&gt; library. It allows Swift tools to parse, inspect, generate, and transform Swift source code.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Its API is designed for performance-critical applications. It uses value types almost exclusively and aims to avoid existential conversions where possible.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;Note: SwiftSyntax is still in development, and the API is not guaranteed to be stable. It&#39;s subject to change without warning.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Declare SwiftPM dependency with release tag&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Add this repository to the &lt;code&gt;Package.swift&lt;/code&gt; manifest of your project:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// swift-tools-version:5.3&#xA;import PackageDescription&#xA;&#xA;let package = Package(&#xA;  name: &#34;MyTool&#34;,&#xA;  dependencies: [&#xA;    .package(name: &#34;SwiftSyntax&#34;, url: &#34;https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax.git&#34;, .exact(&#34;&amp;lt;#Specify Release tag#&amp;gt;&#34;)),&#xA;  ],&#xA;  targets: [&#xA;    .target(name: &#34;MyTool&#34;, dependencies: [&#34;SwiftSyntax&#34;]),&#xA;  ]&#xA;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Replace &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;#Specify Release tag#&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; by the version of SwiftSyntax that you want to use (see the following table for mapping details).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;table&gt; &#xA; &lt;thead&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;Xcode Release&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;Swift Release Tag&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;SwiftSyntax Release Tag&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA; &lt;/thead&gt; &#xA; &lt;tbody&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;Xcode 13.3&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;swift-5.6-RELEASE&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;0.50600.1&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;Xcode 13.0&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;swift-5.5-RELEASE&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;0.50500.0&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;Xcode 12.5&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;swift-5.4-RELEASE&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;0.50400.0&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;Xcode 12.0&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;swift-5.3-RELEASE&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;0.50300.0&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;Xcode 11.4&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;swift-5.2-RELEASE&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td align=&#34;center&#34;&gt;0.50200.0&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA; &lt;/tbody&gt; &#xA;&lt;/table&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then, import &lt;code&gt;SwiftSyntax&lt;/code&gt; in your Swift code.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Documentation&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Documentation can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/raw/main/Documentation&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; and some examples of using SwiftSyntax can be found &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/raw/main/Examples&#34;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Contributing&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Start contributing to SwiftSyntax see &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/raw/main/CONTRIBUTING.md&#34;&gt;this guide&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Reporting Issues&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you should hit any issues while using SwiftSyntax, we appreciate bug reports on &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apple/swift-syntax/issues&#34;&gt;GitHub Issue&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;License&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apple/swift-syntax/main/LICENSE.txt&#34;&gt;LICENSE&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

Normally, you would statically register the keyboard shortcuts upfront in &lt;code&gt;extension KeyboardShortcuts.Name {}&lt;/code&gt;. However, this is not a requirement. It&#39;s only for convenience so that you can use dot-syntax when calling various APIs (for example, &lt;code&gt;.onKeyDown(.unicornMode) {}&lt;/code&gt;). You can create &lt;code&gt;KeyboardShortcut.Name&lt;/code&gt;&#39;s dynamically and store them yourself. You can see this in action in the example project.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Default keyboard shortcuts&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Setting a default keyboard shortcut can be useful if you&#39;re migrating from a different package or just making something for yourself. However, please do not set this for a publicly distributed app. Users find it annoying when random apps steal their existing keyboard shortcuts. It’s generally better to show a welcome screen on the first app launch that lets the user set the shortcut.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;import KeyboardShortcuts&#xA;&#xA;extension KeyboardShortcuts.Name {&#xA;&#x9;static let toggleUnicornMode = Self(&#34;toggleUnicornMode&#34;, default: .init(.k, modifiers: [.command, .option]))&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Get all keyboard shortcuts&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To get all the keyboard shortcut &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt;&#39;s, conform &lt;code&gt;KeyboardShortcuts.Name&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;CaseIterable&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;import KeyboardShortcuts&#xA;&#xA;extension KeyboardShortcuts.Name {&#xA;&#x9;static let foo = Self(&#34;foo&#34;)&#xA;&#x9;static let bar = Self(&#34;bar&#34;)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;extension KeyboardShortcuts.Name: CaseIterable {&#xA;&#x9;public static let allCases: [Self] = [&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;.foo,&#xA;&#x9;&#x9;.bar&#xA;&#x9;]&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// …&#xA;&#xA;print(KeyboardShortcuts.Name.allCases)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;And to get all the &lt;code&gt;Name&lt;/code&gt;&#39;s with a set keyboard shortcut:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;print(KeyboardShortcuts.Name.allCases.filter { $0.shortcut != nil })&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;FAQ&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;How is it different from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/shpakovski/MASShortcut&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;MASShortcut&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This package:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Written in Swift with a swifty API.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;More native-looking UI component.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;SwiftUI component included.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Support for listening to key down, not just key up.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Swift Package Manager support.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Connect a shortcut to an &lt;code&gt;NSMenuItem&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;MASShortcut&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;More mature.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;More localizations.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;How is it different from &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/soffes/HotKey&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;HotKey&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;?&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;HotKey&lt;/code&gt; is good for adding hard-coded keyboard shortcuts, but it doesn&#39;t provide any UI component for the user to choose their own keyboard shortcuts.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Why is this package importing &lt;code&gt;Carbon&lt;/code&gt;? Isn&#39;t that deprecated?&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Most of the Carbon APIs were deprecated years ago, but there are some left that Apple never shipped modern replacements for. This includes registering global keyboard shortcuts. However, you should not need to worry about this. Apple will for sure ship new APIs before deprecating the Carbon APIs used here.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Does this package cause any permission dialogs?&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;No.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;How can I add an app-specific keyboard shortcut that is only active when the app is?&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;That is outside the scope of this package. You can either use &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsevent/1534971-addlocalmonitorforevents&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;NSEvent.addLocalMonitorForEvents&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/appkit/nsmenuitem/2880316-allowskeyequivalentwhenhidden&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;NSMenuItem&lt;/code&gt; with keyboard shortcut&lt;/a&gt; (it can even be hidden), or SwiftUI&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/form/keyboardshortcut(_:)&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;View#keyboardShortcut()&lt;/code&gt; modifier&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Does it support media keys?&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;No, since it would not work for sandboxed apps. If your app is not sandboxed, you can use &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/nhurden/MediaKeyTap&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;MediaKeyTap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Can you support CocoaPods or Carthage?&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;No. However, there is nothing stopping you from using Swift Package Manager for just this package even if you normally use CocoaPods or Carthage.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Related&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sindresorhus/Defaults&#34;&gt;Defaults&lt;/a&gt; - Swifty and modern UserDefaults&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sindresorhus/Regex&#34;&gt;Regex&lt;/a&gt; - Swifty regular expressions&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sindresorhus/Preferences&#34;&gt;Preferences&lt;/a&gt; - Add a preferences window to your macOS app in minutes&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/sindresorhus/LaunchAtLogin&#34;&gt;LaunchAtLogin&lt;/a&gt; - Add &#34;Launch at Login&#34; functionality to your macOS app&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/search?q=user%3Asindresorhus+language%3Aswift&#34;&gt;More…&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Commonly used data structures for Swift&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;Swift Collections&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swift Collections&lt;/strong&gt; is an open-source package of data structure implementations for the Swift programming language.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Read more about the package, and the intent behind it, in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://swift.org/blog/swift-collections&#34;&gt;announcement on swift.org&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Contents&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The package currently provides the following implementations:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apple/swift-collections/main/Documentation/Deque.md&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Deque&amp;lt;Element&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a double-ended queue backed by a ring buffer. Deques are range-replaceable, mutable, random-access collections.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apple/swift-collections/main/Documentation/OrderedSet.md&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;OrderedSet&amp;lt;Element&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a variant of the standard &lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt; where the order of items is well-defined and items can be arbitrarily reordered. Uses a &lt;code&gt;ContiguousArray&lt;/code&gt; as its backing store, augmented by a separate hash table of bit packed offsets into it.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apple/swift-collections/main/Documentation/OrderedDictionary.md&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;OrderedDictionary&amp;lt;Key, Value&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, an ordered variant of the standard &lt;code&gt;Dictionary&lt;/code&gt;, providing similar benefits.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The following data structures are currently being worked on but they aren&#39;t ready for inclusion in a tagged release:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/apple/swift-collections/main/Documentation/Heap.md&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Heap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apple/swift-collections/pull/51&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;PriorityQueue&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, min-max heaps backed by an array.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apple/swift-collections/pull/65&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;SortedSet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SortedDictionary&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, sorted collections backed by in-memory persistent b-trees.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apple/swift-collections/pull/31&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;HashSet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;HashMap&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, persistent hashed collections implemented as Compressed Hash-Array Mapped Prefix-Trees (CHAMP).&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apple/swift-collections/pull/83&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;BitArray&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;BitSet&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, dynamic bit vectors.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apple/swift-collections/pull/80&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;SparseSet&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a constant time set construct, trading off memory for speed.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Swift Collections uses the same modularization approach as &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apple/swift-numerics&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swift Numerics&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;: it provides a standalone module for each thematic group of data structures it implements. For instance, if you only need a double-ended queue type, you can pull in only that by importing &lt;code&gt;DequeModule&lt;/code&gt;. &lt;code&gt;OrderedSet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;OrderedDictionary&lt;/code&gt; share much of the same underlying implementation, so they are provided by a single module, called &lt;code&gt;OrderedCollections&lt;/code&gt;. However, there is also a top-level &lt;code&gt;Collections&lt;/code&gt; module that gives you every collection type with a single import statement:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;import Collections&#xA;&#xA;var deque: Deque&amp;lt;String&amp;gt; = [&#34;Ted&#34;, &#34;Rebecca&#34;]&#xA;deque.prepend(&#34;Keeley&#34;)&#xA;deque.append(&#34;Nathan&#34;)&#xA;print(deque) // [&#34;Keeley&#34;, &#34;Ted&#34;, &#34;Rebecca&#34;, &#34;Nathan&#34;]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Project Status&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Swift Collections package is source stable. The version numbers follow &lt;a href=&#34;https://semver.org&#34;&gt;Semantic Versioning&lt;/a&gt; -- source breaking changes to public API can only land in a new major version.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The public API of version 1.0 of the &lt;code&gt;swift-collections&lt;/code&gt; package consists of non-underscored declarations that are marked &lt;code&gt;public&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;code&gt;Collections&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DequeModule&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;OrderedCollections&lt;/code&gt; modules.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Interfaces that aren&#39;t part of the public API may continue to change in any release, including patch releases. If you have a use case that requires using underscored APIs, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/apple/swift-collections/issues/new?assignees=&amp;amp;labels=enhancement&amp;amp;template=FEATURE_REQUEST.md&#34;&gt;submit a Feature Request&lt;/a&gt; describing it! We&#39;d like the public interface to be as useful as possible -- although preferably without compromising safety or limiting future evolution.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;By &#34;underscored declarations&#34; we mean declarations that have a leading underscore anywhere in their fully qualified name. For instance, here are some names that wouldn&#39;t be considered part of the public API, even if they were technically marked public:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FooModule.Bar._someMember(value:)&lt;/code&gt; (underscored member)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FooModule._Bar.someMember&lt;/code&gt; (underscored type)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;_FooModule.Bar&lt;/code&gt; (underscored module)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;FooModule.Bar.init(_value:)&lt;/code&gt; (underscored initializer)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that contents of the &lt;code&gt;Tests&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Utils&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Benchmarks&lt;/code&gt; subdirectories aren&#39;t public API. We don&#39;t make any source compatibility promises about them -- they may change at whim, and code may be removed in any new release. Do not rely on anything about them.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Future minor versions of the package may update these rules as needed.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We&#39;d like this package to quickly embrace Swift language and toolchain improvements that are relevant to its mandate. Accordingly, from time to time, we expect that new versions of this package will require clients to upgrade to a more recent Swift toolchain release. (This allows the package to make use of new language/stdlib features, build on compiler bug fixes, and adopt new package manager functionality as soon as they are available.) Requiring a new Swift release will only need a minor version bump.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Using &lt;strong&gt;Swift Collections&lt;/strong&gt; in your project&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To use this package in a SwiftPM project, you need to set it up as a package dependency:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// swift-tools-version:5.4&#xA;import PackageDescription&#xA;&#xA;let package = Package(&#xA;  name: &#34;MyPackage&#34;,&#xA;  dependencies: [&#xA;    .package(&#xA;      url: &#34;https://github.com/apple/swift-collections.git&#34;, &#xA;      .upToNextMajor(from: &#34;1.0.0&#34;) // or `.upToNextMinor&#xA;    )&#xA;  ],&#xA;  targets: [&#xA;    .target(&#xA;      name: &#34;MyTarget&#34;,&#xA;      dependencies: [&#xA;        .product(name: &#34;Collections&#34;, package: &#34;swift-collections&#34;)&#xA;      ]&#xA;    )&#xA;  ]&#xA;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Contributing to Swift Collections&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We have a dedicated &lt;a href=&#34;https://forums.swift.org/c/related-projects/collections&#34;&gt;Swift Collections Forum&lt;/a&gt; where people can ask and answer questions on how to use or work on this package.

Sometimes we may need to go through several revisions! This is fine -- it makes the end result that much better.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;When there is a consensus that the feature is ready, and the implementation is fully tested and documented, the PR will be merged by a maintainer.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Celebrate!

You can think of it as a race of publishers, where the first one to emit passes its events, while the others are ignored (there’s also a &lt;code&gt;Collection.amb&lt;/code&gt; method to ease working with multiple publishers).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The name &lt;code&gt;amb&lt;/code&gt; comes from the &lt;a href=&#34;http://reactivex.io/documentation/operators/amb.html&#34;&gt;Reactive Extensions operator&lt;/a&gt;, also known in RxJS as &lt;code&gt;race&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let subject1 = PassthroughSubject&amp;lt;Int, Never&amp;gt;()&#xA;let subject2 = PassthroughSubject&amp;lt;Int, Never&amp;gt;()&#xA;&#xA;subject1&#xA;  .amb(subject2)&#xA;  .sink(receiveCompletion: { print(&#34;amb: completed with \($0)&#34;) },&#xA;        receiveValue: { print(&#34;amb: \($0)&#34;) })&#xA;&#xA;subject2.send(3) // Since this subject emit first, it becomes the active publisher&#xA;subject1.send(1)&#xA;subject2.send(6)&#xA;subject1.send(8)&#xA;subject1.send(7)&#xA;&#xA;subject1.send(completion: .finished)&#xA;// Only when subject2 finishes, amb itself finishes as well, since it&#39;s the active publisher&#xA;subject2.send(completion: .finished)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Output:&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-none&#34;&gt;amb: 3&#xA;amb: 6&#xA;amb: completed with .finished&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;hr&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;materialize&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Convert any publisher to a publisher of its events. Given a &lt;code&gt;Publisher&amp;lt;Output, MyError&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, this operator will return a &lt;code&gt;Publisher&amp;lt;Event&amp;lt;Output, MyError&amp;gt;, Never&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, which means your failure will actually be a regular value, which makes error handling much simpler in many use cases.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let values = PassthroughSubject&amp;lt;String, MyError&amp;gt;()&#xA;enum MyError: Swift.Error {&#xA;  case ohNo&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;values&#xA;  .materialize()&#xA;  .sink(receiveCompletion: { print(&#34;materialized: completed with \($0)&#34;) },&#xA;        receiveValue: { print(&#34;materialized: \($0)&#34;) })&#xA;&#xA;values.send(&#34;Hello&#34;)&#xA;values.send(&#34;World&#34;)&#xA;values.send(&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34;)&#xA;values.send(completion: .failure(.ohNo))&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Output:&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-none&#34;&gt;materialize: .value(&#34;Hello&#34;)&#xA;materialize: .value(&#34;World&#34;)&#xA;materialize: .value(&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34;)&#xA;materialize: .failure(.ohNo)&#xA;materialize: completed with .finished&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;hr&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;values&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Given a materialized publisher, publish only the emitted upstream values, omitting failures.

Given a &lt;code&gt;Publisher&amp;lt;Event&amp;lt;String, MyError&amp;gt;, Never&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, this operator will return a &lt;code&gt;Publisher&amp;lt;MyError, Never&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: This operator only works on publishers that were materialized with the &lt;code&gt;materialize()&lt;/code&gt; operator.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let values = PassthroughSubject&amp;lt;String, MyError&amp;gt;()&#xA;enum MyError: Swift.Error {&#xA;  case ohNo&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;values&#xA;  .materialize()&#xA;  .failures()&#xA;  .sink(receiveValue: { print(&#34;failures: \($0)&#34;) })&#xA;&#xA;values.send(&#34;Hello&#34;)&#xA;values.send(&#34;World&#34;)&#xA;values.send(&#34;What&#39;s up?&#34;)&#xA;values.send(completion: .failure(.ohNo))&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Output:&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-none&#34;&gt;failure: MyError.ohNo&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;hr&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;dematerialize&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Converts a previously-materialized publisher into its original form. Given a &lt;code&gt;Publisher&amp;lt;Event&amp;lt;String, MyError&amp;gt;, Never&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;, this operator will return a &lt;code&gt;Publisher&amp;lt;String, MyError&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Partition a publisher&#39;s values into two separate publishers of values that match, and don&#39;t match, the provided predicate.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let source = PassthroughSubject&amp;lt;Int, Never&amp;gt;()&#xA;&#xA;let (even, odd) = source.partition { $0 % 2 == 0 }&#xA;&#xA;even.sink(receiveValue: { print(&#34;even: \($0)&#34;) })&#xA;odd.sink(receiveValue: { print(&#34;odd: \($0)&#34;) })&#xA;&#xA;source.send(1)&#xA;source.send(2)&#xA;source.send(3)&#xA;source.send(4)&#xA;source.send(5)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This repo includes two overloads on Combine’s &lt;code&gt;Publisher.zip&lt;/code&gt; methods (which, at the time of writing only go up to arity three).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This lets you arbitrarily zip many publishers and receive an array of inner publisher outputs back.&lt;/p&gt;

&#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may also use &lt;code&gt;.zip()&lt;/code&gt; directly on a collection of publishers with the same output and failure types, e.g.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;[first, second, third, fourth]&#xA;  .zip()&#xA;  .map { $0.reduce(0, +) }&#xA;  .sink(receiveValue: { print(&#34;zipped: \($0)&#34;) })&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Output:&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-none&#34;&gt;zipped: 10&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;hr&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;MergeMany&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This repo includes an extension for Collection that allows you to call &lt;code&gt;.merge()&lt;/code&gt; directly on a collection of publishers with the same output and failure types.&lt;/p&gt;

&#xA;&lt;p&gt;This repo includes two overloads on Combine’s &lt;code&gt;Publisher.combineLatest&lt;/code&gt; methods (which, at the time of writing only go up to arity three) and an &lt;code&gt;Collection.combineLatest&lt;/code&gt; constrained extension.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This lets you arbitrarily combine many publishers and receive an array of inner publisher outputs back.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let first = PassthroughSubject&amp;lt;Bool, Never&amp;gt;()&#xA;let second = PassthroughSubject&amp;lt;Bool, Never&amp;gt;()&#xA;let third = PassthroughSubject&amp;lt;Bool, Never&amp;gt;()&#xA;let fourth = PassthroughSubject&amp;lt;Bool, Never&amp;gt;()&#xA;&#xA;subscription = [first, second, third, fourth]&#xA;

&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Publisher.setOutputType(to:)&lt;/code&gt; is an analog to &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher/3204753-setfailuretype&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;.setFailureType(to:)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for when &lt;code&gt;Output&lt;/code&gt; is constrained to &lt;code&gt;Never&lt;/code&gt;. This is especially helpful when chaining operators after an &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher/3204714-ignoreoutput&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;.ignoreOutput()&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; call.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;hr&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;removeAllDuplicates&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Publisher.removeAllDuplicates&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.removeAllDuplicates(by:)&lt;/code&gt; are stricter forms of Apple’s &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher/3204745-removeduplicates&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Publisher.removeDuplicates&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

previous value events, instead of pairwise.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your &lt;code&gt;Output&lt;/code&gt; doesn‘t conform to &lt;code&gt;Hashable&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Equatable&lt;/code&gt;, you may instead use the comparator-based version of this operator to decide whether two elements are equal.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;subscription = [1, 1, 2, 1, 3, 3, 4].publisher&#xA;  .removeAllDuplicates()&#xA;  .sink(receiveValue: { print(&#34;removeAllDuplicates: \($0)&#34;) })&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&#xA;&lt;hr&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;share(replay:)&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Similar to &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher/3204754-share&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Publisher.share&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;code&gt;.share(replay:)&lt;/code&gt;

&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;prefix(duration:)&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;An overload on &lt;code&gt;Publisher.prefix&lt;/code&gt; that that republishes values for a provided &lt;code&gt;duration&lt;/code&gt; (in seconds), and then completes.&lt;/p&gt;

It’s similar to a &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/currentvaluesubject&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;CurrentValueSubject&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; in that it buffers values, but, it takes it a step further in allowing consumers to specify the number of values to buffer and replay to future subscribers. Also, it will handle forwarding any completion events after the buffer is cleared upon subscription.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let subject = ReplaySubject&amp;lt;Int, Never&amp;gt;(bufferSize: 3)&#xA;&#xA;subject.send(1)&#xA;subject.send(2)&#xA;subject.send(3)&#xA;subject.send(4)&#xA;&#xA;subject&#xA;  .sink(receiveValue: { print($0) })&#xA;&#xA;subject.send(5)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Output:&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-none&#34;&gt;2&#xA;3&#xA;4&#xA;5&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;License&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;MIT, of course ;-) See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CombineCommunity/CombineExt/main/LICENSE&#34;&gt;LICENSE&lt;/a&gt; file.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The Apple logo and the Combine framework are property of Apple Inc.&lt;/p&gt;</summary>

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Lazy image loading for Apple platforms: SwiftUI, UIKit, AppKit&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;h1&gt;NukeUI&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;A missing piece in SwiftUI that provides lazy image loading.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;Image&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LazyImage&lt;/code&gt; for SwiftUI (similar to the native &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/AsyncImage&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;AsyncImage&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;ImageView&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LazyImageView&lt;/code&gt; for UIKit and AppKit&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LazyImage&lt;/code&gt; uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kean/Nuke&#34;&gt;Nuke&lt;/a&gt; for loading images so you can take advantage of all of its advanced performance features, such as custom caches, prefetching, task coalescing, smart background decompression, request priorities, and more. And it&#39;s not just that. NukeUI also supports progressive images, has GIF support powered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kaishin/Gifu&#34;&gt;Gifu&lt;/a&gt;, and can even play short videos, which is &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.dev/replace-gifs-with-videos/&#34;&gt;a more efficient&lt;/a&gt; way to display animated images.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;LazyImage&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The view is instantiated with a source where a source can be a &lt;code&gt;String&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;URL&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;URLRequest&lt;/code&gt;, or an &lt;a href=&#34;https://kean.blog/nuke/guides/customizing-requests&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;ImageRequest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct ContainerView: View {&#xA;    var body: some View {&#xA;        LazyImage(source: &#34;https://example.com/image.jpeg&#34;)&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The view is called &#34;lazy&#34; because it loads the image from source only when it appears on the screen. And when it disappears, the current request automatically gets canceled. When the view reappears, the download picks up where it left off, thanks to &lt;a href=&#34;https://kean.blog/post/resumable-downloads&#34;&gt;resumable downloads&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The view doesn&#39;t know the size of the image before it downloads it. Thus, you must specify the view size before loading the image. By default, the image will resize preserving the aspect ratio to fill the available space. You can change this behavior by passing a different resizing mode.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;LazyImage(source: &#34;https://example.com/image.jpeg&#34;, resizingMode: .center)&#xA;    .frame(height: 300)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important&lt;/strong&gt;. You can’t apply image-specific modifiers, like &lt;code&gt;aspectRatio()&lt;/code&gt;, directly to a &lt;code&gt;LazyImage&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Until the image loads, the view displays a standard placeholder that fills the available space, just like &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/SwiftUI/AsyncImage&#34;&gt;AsyncImage&lt;/a&gt; does. After the load completes successfully, the view updates to display the image.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;br&gt; &#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/1567433/121760622-bf4b9080-caf9-11eb-8727-bb53eb1736ea.png&#34; width=&#34;600px&#34;&gt; &#xA;&lt;br&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also specify a custom placeholder, a view to be displayed on failure, or even show a download progress.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;LazyImage(source: $0) { state in&#xA;    if let image = state.image {&#xA;        image // Displays the loaded image&#xA;    } else if state.error != nil {&#xA;        Color.red // Indicates an error&#xA;    } else {&#xA;        Color.blue // Acts as a placeholder&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the image is loaded, it is displayed with a default animation. You can change it using a custom &lt;code&gt;animation&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;LazyImage(source: &#34;https://example.com/image.jpeg&#34;)&#xA;    .animation(nil) // Disable all animations&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can pass a complete &lt;code&gt;ImageRequest&lt;/code&gt; as a source, but you can also configure the download via convenience modifiers.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;LazyImage(source: &#34;https://example.com/image.jpeg&#34;)&#xA;    .processors([ImageProcessors.Resize(width: 44)])&#xA;    .priority(.high)&#xA;    .pipeline(customPipeline)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LazyImage&lt;/code&gt; is built on top of Nuke&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://kean.blog/nuke/guides/swiftui#fetchimage&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;FetchImage&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. If you want even more control, you can use it directly instead.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also monitor the status of the download.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;LazyImage(source: &#34;https://example.com/image.jpeg&#34;)&#xA;    .onStart { print(&#34;Task started \($0)&#34;) }&#xA;    .onProgress { ... }&#xA;    .onSuccess { ... }&#xA;    .onFailure { ... }&#xA;    .onCompletion { ... }&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;And if some API isn&#39;t exposed yet, you can always access the underlying &lt;code&gt;ImageView&lt;/code&gt; instance.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;LazyImage(source: &#34;https://example.com/image.jpeg&#34;)&#xA;    .onCreated { view in &#xA;        view.videoGravity = .resizeAspect&#xA;    }&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;LazyImageView&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LazyImageView&lt;/code&gt; is a &lt;code&gt;LazyImage&lt;/code&gt; counterpart for UIKit and AppKit with the equivalent set of APIs.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let imageView = LazyImageView()&#xA;imageView.placeholderView = UIActivityIndicatorView()&#xA;imageView.priority = .high&#xA;imageView.pipeline = customPipeline&#xA;imageView.onCompletion = { print(&#34;Request completed&#34;)&#xA;&#xA;imageView.source = &#34;https://example.com/image.jpeg&#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Image and ImageView&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Image&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;ImageView&lt;/code&gt; are image components that support the same image formats that lazy variants (including animated images and video), but you can use them to display an already available image.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let container = ImageContainer(image: UIImage(data: data), data: data, type: .gif)&#xA;Image(container)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Animated Images&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;All image components in NukeUI support GIF playback powered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/kaishin/Gifu&#34;&gt;Gifu&lt;/a&gt; rendering engine. Please keep in mind that GIF rendering is expensive and can result in high CPU, battery, and memory usage. A best practice is to &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.dev/replace-gifs-with-videos/&#34;&gt;replace GIF with video&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Video&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;All image components in NukeUI support video playback. It&#39;s aimed to be a replacement for GIF, which is &lt;a href=&#34;https://web.dev/replace-gifs-with-videos/&#34;&gt;inefficient&lt;/a&gt;. With video, you get an order of magnitude smaller files and hardware-accelerated playback. In practice, it means that instead of a 20 MB GIF you can now download a ~2 MB video of comparable quality. And instead of 60% CPU usage and high energy impact, you&#39;ll see 0%.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Important:&lt;/strong&gt; The number of players you can have at once on-screen is limited. The limit is not documented and depends on the platform. In general, expect to have about four players playing at once.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Extending Rendering System&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;NukeUI allows you to extend image rendering system in case you need to support additional image format. And there are only two simple steps to do that.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 1&lt;/strong&gt;. Register a custom decoder with Nuke.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;ImageDecoderRegistry.shared.register { context in&#xA;    let isSVG = context.urlResponse?.url?.absoluteString.hasSuffix(&#34;.svg&#34;) ?? false&#xA;    return isSVG ? ImageDecoders.Empty(imageType: .svg) : nil&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;extension ImageType {&#xA;    public static let svg: ImageType = &#34;public.svg&#34;&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;Learn more about the decoding infrastructure in &lt;a href=&#34;https://kean.blog/nuke/guides/image-formats&#34;&gt;&#34;Image Formats.&#34;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Step 2&lt;/strong&gt;. Register a custom image view.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;import SwiftSVG&#xA;&#xA;// Affects both all image components, including `LazyImage` and `Image`&#xA;ImageView.registerContentView {&#xA;   if $0.type == .svg, let string = $0.data.map( {&#xA;       UIView(svgData: data)&#xA;   }&#xA;   return nil&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Minimum Requirements&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;table&gt; &#xA; &lt;thead&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;NukeUI&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;Swift&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;Xcode&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;   &lt;th&gt;Platforms&lt;/th&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA; &lt;/thead&gt; &#xA; &lt;tbody&gt; &#xA;  &lt;tr&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;NukeUI 0.1&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Swift 5.3&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;Xcode 12.0&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;   &lt;td&gt;iOS 11.0 / watchOS 5.0 / macOS 10.13 / tvOS 11.0&lt;/td&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/tr&gt; &#xA; &lt;/tbody&gt; &#xA;&lt;/table&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;LazyImage&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Image&lt;/code&gt; are available on the following platforms: iOS 14.0 / watchOS 7.0 / macOS 10.16 / tvOS 14.0&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;License&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;NukeUI is available under the MIT license.

    <summary type="html">&lt;p&gt;Elegant transition library for iOS &amp; tvOS&lt;/p&gt;&lt;hr&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.rawgit.com/lkzhao/Hero/427d5f2/Resources/Hero.svg?sanitize=true&#34; width=&#34;388&#34;&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Hero&lt;/strong&gt; is a library for building iOS view controller transitions. It provides a declarative layer on top of the UIKit&#39;s cumbersome transition APIs—making custom transitions an easy task for developers.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://img.shields.io/badge/Carthage-Compatible-brightgreen.svg?style=flat&#34; alt=&#34;Carthage compatible&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/JamitLabs/Accio&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://img.shields.io/badge/Accio-supported-0A7CF5.svg?style=flat&#34; alt=&#34;Accio supported&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://codecov.io/gh/HeroTransitions/Hero&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://codecov.io/gh/HeroTransitions/Hero/branch/develop/graph/badge.svg?sanitize=true&#34; alt=&#34;codecov&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;http://cocoapods.org/pods/Hero&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/v/Hero.svg?style=flat&#34; alt=&#34;Version&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lkzhao/Hero/raw/master/LICENSE?raw=true&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://img.shields.io/cocoapods/l/Hero.svg?style=flat&#34; alt=&#34;License&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://img.shields.io/badge/Xcode-9.0%2B-blue.svg?sanitize=true&#34; alt=&#34;Xcode 9.0+&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://img.shields.io/badge/iOS-8.0%2B-blue.svg?sanitize=true&#34; alt=&#34;iOS 8.0+&#34;&gt; &lt;img src=&#34;https://img.shields.io/badge/Swift-4.0%2B-orange.svg?sanitize=true&#34; alt=&#34;Swift 4.0+&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lkzhao/Hero/raw/master/README.zh-cn.md&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://img.shields.io/badge/%E4%B8%AD%E6%96%87-README-blue.svg?style=flat&#34; alt=&#34;中文 README&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_s-xclick&amp;amp;hosted_button_id=NT5F7Y2MPV7RE&#34;&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://img.shields.io/badge/Donate-PayPal-blue.svg?sanitize=true&#34; alt=&#34;Donate&#34;&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.rawgit.com/lkzhao/Hero/ebb3f2c/Resources/features.svg?sanitize=true&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.rawgit.com/lkzhao/Hero/ebb3f2c/Resources/features2.svg?sanitize=true&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hero is similar to Keynote&#39;s &lt;strong&gt;Magic Move&lt;/strong&gt;. It checks the &lt;code&gt;heroID&lt;/code&gt; property on all source and destination views. Every matched view pair is then automatically transitioned from its old state to its new state.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hero can also construct animations for unmatched views. It is easy to define these animations via the &lt;code&gt;heroModifiers&lt;/code&gt; property. Hero will run these animations alongside the &lt;strong&gt;Magic Move&lt;/strong&gt; animations. All of these animations can be &lt;strong&gt;interactively controlled&lt;/strong&gt; by user gestures.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;At view controller level, Hero provides several template transitions that you can set through &lt;code&gt;heroModalAnimationType&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;heroNavigationAnimationType&lt;/code&gt;, and &lt;code&gt;heroTabBarAnimationType&lt;/code&gt;. These can be used as the foundation of your custom transitions. Combine with &lt;code&gt;heroID&lt;/code&gt; &amp;amp; &lt;code&gt;heroModifiers&lt;/code&gt; to make your own unique transitions.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.rawgit.com/lkzhao/Hero/ebb3f2c/Resources/defaultAnimations.svg?sanitize=true&#34;&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp; &lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.rawgit.com/lkzhao/Hero/ebb3f2c/Resources/defaultAnimations2.svg?sanitize=true&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;By default, Hero provides &lt;strong&gt;dynamic duration&lt;/strong&gt; based on the &lt;a href=&#34;https://material.io/design/motion/speed.html#easing&#34;&gt;Material Design Motion Guide&lt;/a&gt;. Duration is automatically determined by changes to distance and size—saving you the hassle, while providing consistent and delightful animations.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Hero doesn&#39;t make any assumptions about how the view is built or structured. It won&#39;t modify any of your views&#39; states other than hiding them during the animation. This makes it work with &lt;strong&gt;Auto Layout&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;programmatic layout&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;UICollectionView&lt;/strong&gt; (without modifying its layout object), &lt;strong&gt;UITableView&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;UINavigationController&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;UITabBarController&lt;/strong&gt;, etc...&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Usage Example 1&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.rawgit.com/lkzhao/Hero/ebb3f2c/Resources/simple.svg?sanitize=true&#34;&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;View Controller 1&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;redView.hero.id = &#34;ironMan&#34;&#xA;blackView.hero.id = &#34;batMan&#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;View Controller 2&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;self.hero.isEnabled = true&#xA;redView.hero.id = &#34;ironMan&#34;&#xA;blackView.hero.id = &#34;batMan&#34;&#xA;whiteView.hero.modifiers = [.translate(y:100)]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Usage Example 2&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.rawgit.com/lkzhao/Hero/ebb3f2c/Resources/advanced.svg?sanitize=true&#34;&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;View Controller 1&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;greyView.hero.id = &#34;skyWalker&#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;View Controller 2&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;self.hero.isEnabled = true&#xA;greyView.hero.id = &#34;skyWalker&#34;&#xA;&#xA;// collectionView is the parent view of all red cells&#xA;collectionView.hero.modifiers = [.cascade]&#xA;for cell in redCells {&#xA;    cell.hero.modifiers = [.fade, .scale(0.5)]&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can do these in the &lt;strong&gt;storyboard&lt;/strong&gt; too!&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.rawgit.com/lkzhao/Hero/master/Resources/storyboardView.png&#34; width=&#34;267px&#34;&gt; &#xA;&lt;img src=&#34;https://cdn.rawgit.com/lkzhao/Hero/master/Resources/storyboardViewController.png&#34; width=&#34;267px&#34;&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Installation&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;CocoaPods&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Add the following entry to your Podfile:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-rb&#34;&gt;pod &#39;Hero&#39;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then run &lt;code&gt;pod install&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t forget to &lt;code&gt;import Hero&lt;/code&gt; in every file you&#39;d like to use Hero.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Carthage&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Add the following entry to your &lt;code&gt;Cartfile&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-text&#34;&gt;github &#34;HeroTransitions/Hero&#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then run &lt;code&gt;carthage update&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If this is your first time using Carthage in the project, you&#39;ll need to go through some additional steps as explained &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/Carthage/Carthage#adding-frameworks-to-an-application&#34;&gt;over at Carthage&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Accio&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Add the following to your &lt;code&gt;Package.swift&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;.package(url: &#34;https://github.com/HeroTransitions/Hero.git&#34;, .upToNextMajor(from: &#34;1.4.0&#34;)),&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Next, add &lt;code&gt;Hero&lt;/code&gt; to your App targets dependencies like so:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;.target(&#xA;    name: &#34;App&#34;,&#xA;    dependencies: [&#xA;        &#34;Hero&#34;,&#xA;    ]&#xA;),&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then run &lt;code&gt;accio update&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Swift Package Manager&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To integrate using Apple&#39;s Swift package manager, add the following as a dependency to your &lt;code&gt;Package.swift&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;.package(url: &#34;https://github.com/HeroTransitions/Hero.git&#34;, .upToNextMajor(from: &#34;1.3.0&#34;))&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;and then specify &lt;code&gt;&#34;Hero&#34;&lt;/code&gt; as a dependency of the Target in which you wish to use Hero.

Local coordinate spaced views might be covered by other global coordinate spaced views. To solve this, use the &lt;code&gt;useGlobalCoordinateSpace&lt;/code&gt; modifier on the views being covered. Checkout &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/lkzhao/Hero/wiki/Coordinate-Space&#34;&gt;Coordinate Space Wiki page&lt;/a&gt; for details.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Push animation is shown along side my custom animation&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is the default animation for navigation controller provided by Hero. To disable the push animation, set &lt;code&gt;self.hero.navigationAnimationType&lt;/code&gt; to &lt;code&gt;.fade&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;.none&lt;/code&gt; on the navigation controller.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How do I use a different default animation when dismissing&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can use the animation type &lt;code&gt;.selectBy(presenting:dismissing)&lt;/code&gt; to specify a different default animation for dismiss.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;    self.hero.modalAnimationType = .selectBy(presenting:.zoom, dismissing:.zoomOut)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Contribute&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We welcome any contributions.

It has robust concurrency primitives, so that multi-threaded applications can efficiently use their databases. It grants your application models with persistence and fetching methods, so that you don&#39;t have to deal with SQL and raw database rows when you don&#39;t want to.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Compared to &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/stephencelis/SQLite.swift&#34;&gt;SQLite.swift&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/ccgus/fmdb&#34;&gt;FMDB&lt;/a&gt;, GRDB can spare you a lot of glue code. Compared to &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/Cocoa/Conceptual/CoreData/&#34;&gt;Core Data&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;http://realm.io&#34;&gt;Realm&lt;/a&gt;, it can simplify your multi-threaded applications.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;It comes with &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#documentation&#34;&gt;up-to-date documentation&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#general-guides--good-practices&#34;&gt;general guides&lt;/a&gt;, and it is &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/wiki/Performance&#34;&gt;fast&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/WhyAdoptGRDB.md&#34;&gt;Why Adopt GRDB?&lt;/a&gt; if you are looking for your favorite database library.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;hr&gt; &#xA;&lt;p align=&#34;center&#34;&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#features&#34;&gt;Features&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#usage&#34;&gt;Usage&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#installation&#34;&gt;Installation&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#documentation&#34;&gt;Documentation&lt;/a&gt; • &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#faq&#34;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt; &lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;hr&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Features&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Programming tools for both database beginners and SQLite experts:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#sqlite-api&#34;&gt;Access to raw SQL and SQLite&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#records&#34;&gt;Records&lt;/a&gt;: Fetching and persistence methods for your custom structs and class hierarchies.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#the-query-interface&#34;&gt;Query Interface&lt;/a&gt;: A swift way to avoid the SQL language.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/AssociationsBasics.md&#34;&gt;Associations&lt;/a&gt;: Relations and joins between record types.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-pools&#34;&gt;WAL Mode Support&lt;/a&gt;: Extra performance for multi-threaded applications.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/Migrations.md&#34;&gt;Migrations&lt;/a&gt;: Transform your database as your application evolves.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-changes-observation&#34;&gt;Database Observation&lt;/a&gt;: Observe database changes and transactions.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/FullTextSearch.md&#34;&gt;Full-Text Search&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#encryption&#34;&gt;Encryption&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/CustomSQLiteBuilds.md&#34;&gt;Support for Custom SQLite Builds&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In-depth integration with our programming environment:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/Concurrency.md&#34;&gt;Swift Concurrency&lt;/a&gt;: &lt;code&gt;try await&lt;/code&gt; your database (Xcode 13.3.1+).&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/groue/GRDBQuery&#34;&gt;SwiftUI&lt;/a&gt;: Access and observe the database from your SwiftUI views.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/Combine.md&#34;&gt;Combine&lt;/a&gt;: Access and observe the database with Combine publishers.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://github.com/RxSwiftCommunity/RxGRDB&#34;&gt;RxSwift&lt;/a&gt;: Access and observe the database with RxSwift observables.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Usage&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;details open&gt; &#xA; &lt;summary&gt;Start using the database in four steps&lt;/summary&gt; &#xA; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;import GRDB&#xA;&#xA;// 1.

To use GRDB with CocoaPods (version 1.2 or higher), specify in your &lt;code&gt;Podfile&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ruby&#34;&gt;pod &#39;GRDB.swift&#39;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;GRDB can be installed as a framework, or a static library.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Swift Package Manager&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://swift.org/package-manager/&#34;&gt;Swift Package Manager&lt;/a&gt; automates the distribution of Swift code. To use GRDB with SPM, add a dependency to &lt;code&gt;https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift.git&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;GRDB offers two libraries, &lt;code&gt;GRDB&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;GRDB-dynamic&lt;/code&gt;. Pick only one. When in doubt, prefer &lt;code&gt;GRDB&lt;/code&gt;. The &lt;code&gt;GRDB-dynamic&lt;/code&gt; library can reveal useful if you are going to link it with multiple targets within your app and only wish to link to a shared, dynamic framework once. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://forums.swift.org/t/how-to-link-a-swift-package-as-dynamic/32062&#34;&gt;How to link a Swift Package as dynamic&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Linux is not currently supported.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;⚠&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt;: Due to an Xcode bug, you will get &#34;No such module &#39;CSQLite&#39;&#34; errors when you want to embed the GRDB package in other targets than the main application (watch extensions, for example).

The connection is closed when the database queue gets deinitialized.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A database queue can be used from any thread.&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; methods are synchronous, and block the current thread until your database statements are executed in a protected dispatch queue:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Modify the database:&#xA;try dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    try db.create(table: &#34;place&#34;) { ... }&#xA;    try Place(...).insert(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// Read values:&#xA;try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    let places = try Place.fetchAll(db)&#xA;    let placeCount = try Place.fetchCount(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Database access methods can return values:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let placeCount = try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    try Place.fetchCount(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;let newPlaceCount = try dbQueue.write { db -&amp;gt; Int in&#xA;    try Place(...).insert(db)&#xA;    return try Place.fetchCount(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A database queue serializes accesses to the database&lt;/strong&gt;, which means that there is never more than one thread that uses the database.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you don&#39;t need to modify the database, prefer the &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; method. It prevents any modification to the database.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; method wraps your database statements in a transaction that commits if and only if no error occurs. On the first unhandled error, all changes are reverted, the whole transaction is rollbacked, and the error is rethrown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When precise transaction handling is required, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#transactions-and-savepoints&#34;&gt;Transactions and Savepoints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A database queue needs your application to follow rules in order to deliver its safety guarantees.&lt;/strong&gt; Please refer to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/Concurrency.md&#34;&gt;Concurrency&lt;/a&gt; guide.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-configuration&#34;&gt;Database Configuration&lt;/a&gt; for DatabaseQueue options.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/DemoApps&#34;&gt;Demo Applications&lt;/a&gt; for sample code.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Database Pools&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A database pool allows concurrent database accesses.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;import GRDB&#xA;let dbPool = try DatabasePool(path: &#34;/path/to/database.sqlite&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;SQLite creates the database file if it does not already exist.

The WAL mode does not fit all situations. Please have a look at &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html&#34;&gt;https://www.sqlite.org/wal.html&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A database pool can be used from any thread.&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; methods are synchronous, and block the current thread until your database statements are executed in a protected dispatch queue:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Modify the database:&#xA;try dbPool.write { db in&#xA;    try db.create(table: &#34;place&#34;) { ... }&#xA;    try Place(...).insert(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// Read values:&#xA;try dbPool.read { db in&#xA;    let places = try Place.fetchAll(db)&#xA;    let placeCount = try Place.fetchCount(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Database access methods can return values:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let placeCount = try dbPool.read { db in&#xA;    try Place.fetchCount(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;let newPlaceCount = try dbPool.write { db -&amp;gt; Int in&#xA;    try Place(...).insert(db)&#xA;    return try Place.fetchCount(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Database pools allow several threads to access the database at the same time:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you don&#39;t need to modify the database, prefer the &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; method, because several threads can perform reads in parallel.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reads are generally non-blocking, unless the maximum number of concurrent reads has been reached. In this case, a read has to wait for another read to complete. That maximum number can be &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-configuration&#34;&gt;configured&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Reads are guaranteed an immutable view of the last committed state of the database, regardless of concurrent writes. This kind of isolation is called &lt;a href=&#34;https://sqlite.org/isolation.html&#34;&gt;snapshot isolation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Unlike reads, writes are serialized. There is never more than a single thread that is writing into the database.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; method wraps your database statements in a transaction that commits if and only if no error occurs. On the first unhandled error, all changes are reverted, the whole transaction is rollbacked, and the error is rethrown.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;When precise transaction handling is required, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#transactions-and-savepoints&#34;&gt;Transactions and Savepoints&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Database pools can take &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/Concurrency.md#database-snapshots&#34;&gt;snapshots&lt;/a&gt; of the database.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A database pool needs your application to follow rules in order to deliver its safety guarantees.&lt;/strong&gt; See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/Concurrency.md&#34;&gt;Concurrency&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All those fetching methods require an SQL string that contains a single SQL statement.&lt;/strong&gt; When you want to fetch from multiple statements joined with a semicolon, iterate the multiple &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#prepared-statements&#34;&gt;prepared statements&lt;/a&gt; found in the SQL string:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let statements = try db.allStatements(sql: &#34;&#34;&#34;&#xA;    SELECT ...; &#xA;    SELECT ...; &#xA;

method, like the SQLite &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/exec.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;sqlite3_exec&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// A single cursor of all rows from all statements&#xA;let rows = try db&#xA;    .allStatements(sql: &#34;...&#34;)&#xA;    .flatMap { statement in try Row.fetchCursor(statement) }&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#prepared-statements&#34;&gt;prepared statements&lt;/a&gt; for more information about &lt;code&gt;allStatements()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Cursors&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Whenever you consume several rows from the database, you can fetch an Array, a Set, or a Cursor&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;fetchAll()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fetchSet()&lt;/code&gt; methods return regular Swift array and sets, that you iterate like all other arrays and sets:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    // [Player]&#xA;    let players = try Player.fetchAll(db, sql: &#34;SELECT ...&#34;)&#xA;    for player in players {&#xA;        // use player&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike arrays and sets, cursors returned by &lt;code&gt;fetchCursor()&lt;/code&gt; load their results step after step:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    // Cursor of Player&#xA;    let players = try Player.fetchCursor(db, sql: &#34;SELECT ...&#34;)&#xA;    while let player = try players.next() {&#xA;        // use player&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursors can not be used on any thread&lt;/strong&gt;: you must consume a cursor on the dispatch queue it was created in. Particularly, don&#39;t extract a cursor out of a database access method:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Wrong&#xA;let cursor = try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    try Player.fetchCursor(db, ...)&#xA;}&#xA;while let player = try cursor.next() { ... }&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Conversely, arrays and sets may be consumed on any thread:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// OK&#xA;let array = try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    try Player.fetchAll(db, ...)&#xA;}&#xA;for player in array { ... }&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursors can be iterated only one time.&lt;/strong&gt; Arrays and sets can be iterated many times.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursors iterate database results in a lazy fashion&lt;/strong&gt;, and don&#39;t consume much memory. Arrays and sets contain copies of database values, and may take a lot of memory when there are many fetched results.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursors are granted with direct access to SQLite,&lt;/strong&gt; unlike arrays and sets that have to take the time to copy database values. If you look after extra performance, you may prefer cursors.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursors can feed Swift collections.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will most of the time use &lt;code&gt;fetchAll&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;fetchSet&lt;/code&gt; when you want an array or a set. For more specific needs, you may prefer one of the initializers below. All of them accept an extra optional &lt;code&gt;minimumCapacity&lt;/code&gt; argument which helps optimizing your app when you have an idea of the number of elements in a cursor (the built-in &lt;code&gt;fetchAll&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fetchSet&lt;/code&gt; do not perform such an optimization).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Arrays&lt;/strong&gt; and all types conforming to &lt;code&gt;RangeReplaceableCollection&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// [String]&#xA;let cursor = try String.fetchCursor(db, ...)&#xA;let array = try Array(cursor)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sets&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Set&amp;lt;Int&amp;gt;&#xA;let cursor = try Int.fetchCursor(db, ...)&#xA;let set = try Set(cursor)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Dictionaries&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// [Int64: [Player]]&#xA;let cursor = try Player.fetchCursor(db)&#xA;let dictionary = try Dictionary(grouping: cursor, by: { $0.teamID })&#xA;&#xA;// [Int64: Player]&#xA;let cursor = try Player.fetchCursor(db).map { ($0.id, $0) }&#xA;let dictionary = try Dictionary(uniqueKeysWithValues: cursor)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursors adopt the &lt;a href=&#34;http://groue.github.io/GRDB.swift/docs/5.24/Protocols/Cursor.html&#34;&gt;Cursor&lt;/a&gt; protocol, which looks a lot like standard &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/reference/swift/lazysequenceprotocol&#34;&gt;lazy sequences&lt;/a&gt; of Swift.&lt;/strong&gt; As such, cursors come with many convenience methods: &lt;code&gt;compactMap&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;contains&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dropFirst&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;dropLast&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;drop(while:)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;enumerated&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;first&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;flatMap&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;forEach&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;joined&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;joined(separator:)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;max&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;max(by:)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;min&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;min(by:)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;prefix&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;prefix(while:)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;reduce&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;reduce(into:)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;suffix&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Prints all Github links&#xA;try URL&#xA;    .fetchCursor(db, sql: &#34;SELECT url FROM link&#34;)&#xA;    .filter { url in url.host == &#34;github.com&#34; }&#xA;    .forEach { url in print(url) }&#xA;&#xA;// An efficient cursor of coordinates:&#xA;let locations = try Row.&#xA;    .fetchCursor(db, sql: &#34;SELECT latitude, longitude FROM place&#34;)&#xA;    .map { row in&#xA;        CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: row[0], longitude: row[1])&#xA;    }&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursors are not Swift sequences.&lt;/strong&gt; That&#39;s because Swift sequences can&#39;t handle iteration errors, when reading SQLite results may fail at any time.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Cursors require a little care&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t modify the results during a cursor iteration:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Undefined behavior&#xA;while let player = try players.next() {&#xA;    try db.execute(sql: &#34;DELETE ...&#34;)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t turn a cursor of &lt;code&gt;Row&lt;/code&gt; into an array or a set.

See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#fatal-errors&#34;&gt;Fatal Errors&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQLite has a weak type system, and provides &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/column_blob.html&#34;&gt;convenience conversions&lt;/a&gt; that can turn String to Int, Double to Blob, etc.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;GRDB will sometimes let those conversions go through:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let rows = try Row.fetchCursor(db, sql: &#34;SELECT &#39;20 small cigars&#39;&#34;)&#xA;while let row = try rows.next() {&#xA;    row[0] as Int   // 20&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Don&#39;t freak out: those conversions did not prevent SQLite from becoming the immensely successful database engine you want to use. And GRDB adds safety checks described just above. You can also prevent those convenience conversions altogether by using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#databasevalue&#34;&gt;DatabaseValue&lt;/a&gt; type.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;DatabaseValue&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DatabaseValue is an intermediate type between SQLite and your values, which gives information about the raw value stored in the database.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You get DatabaseValue just like other value types:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let dbValue: DatabaseValue = row[0]&#xA;let dbValue: DatabaseValue? = row[&#34;name&#34;] // nil if and only if column does not exist&#xA;&#xA;// Check for NULL:&#xA;dbValue.isNull // Bool&#xA;&#xA;// The stored value:&#xA;dbValue.storage.value // Int64, Double, String, Data, or nil&#xA;&#xA;// All the five storage classes supported by SQLite:&#xA;switch dbValue.storage {&#xA;case .null:                 print(&#34;NULL&#34;)&#xA;case .int64(let int64):     print(&#34;Int64: \(int64)&#34;)&#xA;case .double(let double):   print(&#34;Double: \(double)&#34;)&#xA;case .string(let string):   print(&#34;String: \(string)&#34;)&#xA;case .blob(let data):       print(&#34;Data: \(data)&#34;)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can extract regular &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#values&#34;&gt;values&lt;/a&gt; (Bool, Int, String, Date, Swift enums, etc.) from DatabaseValue with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#custom-value-types&#34;&gt;DatabaseValueConvertible.fromDatabaseValue()&lt;/a&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let dbValue: DatabaseValue = row[&#34;bookCount&#34;]&#xA;let bookCount   = Int.fromDatabaseValue(dbValue)   // Int?&#xA;let bookCount64 = Int64.fromDatabaseValue(dbValue) // Int64?&#xA;let hasBooks    = Bool.fromDatabaseValue(dbValue)  // Bool?, false when 0&#xA;&#xA;let dbValue: DatabaseValue = row[&#34;date&#34;]&#xA;let string = String.fromDatabaseValue(dbValue)     // &#34;2015-09-11 18:14:15.123&#34;&#xA;let date   = Date.fromDatabaseValue(dbValue)       // Date?&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;fromDatabaseValue&lt;/code&gt; returns nil for invalid conversions:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let row = try Row.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT &#39;Mom’s birthday&#39;&#34;)!&#xA;let dbValue: DatabaseValue = row[0]&#xA;let string = String.fromDatabaseValue(dbValue) // &#34;Mom’s birthday&#34;&#xA;let int    = Int.fromDatabaseValue(dbValue)    // nil&#xA;let date   = Date.fromDatabaseValue(dbValue)   // nil&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Rows as Dictionaries&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Row adopts the standard &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/randomaccesscollection&#34;&gt;RandomAccessCollection&lt;/a&gt; protocol, and can be seen as a dictionary of &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#databasevalue&#34;&gt;DatabaseValue&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// All the (columnName, dbValue) tuples, from left to right:&#xA;for (columnName, dbValue) in row {&#xA;    ...&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can build rows from dictionaries&lt;/strong&gt; (standard Swift dictionaries and NSDictionary). See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#values&#34;&gt;Values&lt;/a&gt; for more information on supported types:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let row: Row = [&#34;name&#34;: &#34;foo&#34;, &#34;date&#34;: nil]&#xA;let row = Row([&#34;name&#34;: &#34;foo&#34;, &#34;date&#34;: nil])&#xA;let row = Row(/* [AnyHashable: Any] */) // nil if invalid dictionary&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet rows are not real dictionaries: they may contain duplicate columns:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let row = try Row.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT 1 AS foo, 2 AS foo&#34;)!&#xA;row.columnNames    // [&#34;foo&#34;, &#34;foo&#34;]&#xA;row.databaseValues // [1, 2]&#xA;row[&#34;foo&#34;]         // 1 (leftmost matching column)&#xA;for (columnName, dbValue) in row { ... } // (&#34;foo&#34;, 1), (&#34;foo&#34;, 2)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you build a dictionary from a row&lt;/strong&gt;, you have to disambiguate identical columns, and choose how to present database values. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;[String: DatabaseValue]&lt;/code&gt; dictionary that keeps leftmost value in case of duplicated column name:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let dict = Dictionary(row, uniquingKeysWith: { (left, _) in left })&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;[String: AnyObject]&lt;/code&gt; dictionary which keeps rightmost value in case of duplicated column name. This dictionary is identical to FMResultSet&#39;s resultDictionary from FMDB. It contains NSNull values for null columns, and can be shared with Objective-C:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let dict = Dictionary(&#xA;    row.map { (column, dbValue) in&#xA;        (column, dbValue.storage.value as AnyObject)&#xA;    },&#xA;    uniquingKeysWith: { (_, right) in right })&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;[String: Any]&lt;/code&gt; dictionary that can feed, for example, JSONSerialization:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let dict = Dictionary(&#xA;    row.map { (column, dbValue) in&#xA;        (column, dbValue.storage.value)&#xA;    },&#xA;    uniquingKeysWith: { (left, _) in left })&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See the documentation of &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/dictionary/2892961-init&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;Dictionary.init(_:uniquingKeysWith:)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Value Queries&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead of rows, you can directly fetch &lt;strong&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#values&#34;&gt;values&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;. Like rows, fetch them as &lt;strong&gt;cursors&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;arrays&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;sets&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;single&lt;/strong&gt; values (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#fetching-methods&#34;&gt;fetching methods&lt;/a&gt;).

Sharing the same representation in your database and in JSON files only provides a superficial convenience, and should be the least of your priorities. Don&#39;t store dates as ISO-8601 without understanding what you lose. For example, ISO-8601 time zones forbid database-level date comparison.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Sub-millisecond precision and exact &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt; roundtrip are not as obvious needs as it seems at first sight. Dates generally don&#39;t precisely roundtrip as soon as they leave your application anyway, because the other systems your app communicates with use their own date representation (the Android version of your app, the server your application is talking to, etc.) On top of that, &lt;code&gt;Date&lt;/code&gt; comparison is at least as hard and nasty as &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.google.com/search?q=floating+point+comparison+is+hard&#34;&gt;floating point comparison&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The customization of date format is explicit. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let date = Date()&#xA;let timeInterval = date.timeIntervalSinceReferenceDate&#xA;try db.execute(&#xA;    sql: &#34;INSERT INTO player (creationDate, ...)

&lt;/tbody&gt; &#xA;&lt;/table&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;All three types can decode database integers and doubles:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let number = try NSNumber.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT 10&#34;)            // NSNumber&#xA;let number = try NSDecimalNumber.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT 1.23&#34;)   // NSDecimalNumber&#xA;let number = try Decimal.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT -100&#34;)           // Decimal&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;All three types decode database strings as decimal numbers:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let number = try NSNumber.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT &#39;10&#39;&#34;)          // NSDecimalNumber (sic)&#xA;let number = try NSDecimalNumber.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT &#39;1.23&#39;&#34;) // NSDecimalNumber&#xA;let number = try Decimal.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT &#39;-100&#39;&#34;)         // Decimal&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;NSNumber&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;NSDecimalNumber&lt;/code&gt; send 64-bit signed integers and doubles in the database:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// INSERT INTO transfer VALUES (10)&#xA;try db.execute(sql: &#34;INSERT INTO transfer VALUES (?)&#34;, arguments: [NSNumber(value: 10)])&#xA;&#xA;// INSERT INTO transfer VALUES (10.0)&#xA;try db.execute(sql: &#34;INSERT INTO transfer VALUES (?)&#34;, arguments: [NSNumber(value: 10.0)])&#xA;&#xA;// INSERT INTO transfer VALUES (10)&#xA;try db.execute(sql: &#34;INSERT INTO transfer VALUES (?)&#34;, arguments: [NSDecimalNumber(string: &#34;10.0&#34;)])&#xA;&#xA;// INSERT INTO transfer VALUES (10.5)&#xA;try db.execute(sql: &#34;INSERT INTO transfer VALUES (?)&#34;, arguments: [NSDecimalNumber(string: &#34;10.5&#34;)])&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

can result in a loss of precision during the conversion to double.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;   &lt;p&gt;Instead of sending non-integer &lt;code&gt;NSDecimalNumber&lt;/code&gt; to the database, you may prefer:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;   &lt;ul&gt; &#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Send &lt;code&gt;Decimal&lt;/code&gt; instead (those store decimal strings in the database).&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;    &lt;li&gt;Send integers instead (for example, store amounts of cents instead of amounts of Euros).&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Decimal&lt;/code&gt; sends decimal strings in the database:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// INSERT INTO transfer VALUES (&#39;10&#39;)&#xA;try db.execute(sql: &#34;INSERT INTO transfer VALUES (?)&#34;, arguments: [Decimal(10)])&#xA;&#xA;// INSERT INTO transfer VALUES (&#39;10.5&#39;)&#xA;try db.execute(sql: &#34;INSERT INTO transfer VALUES (?)&#34;, arguments: [Decimal(string: &#34;10.5&#34;)!])&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&#xA;&lt;p&gt;GRDB stores uuids as 16-bytes data blobs, and decodes them from both 16-bytes data blobs and strings such as &#34;E621E1F8-C36C-495A-93FC-0C247A3E6E5F&#34;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Swift Enums&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Swift enums&lt;/strong&gt; and generally all types that adopt the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/library/tvos/documentation/Swift/Reference/Swift_RawRepresentable_Protocol/index.html&#34;&gt;RawRepresentable&lt;/a&gt; protocol can be stored and fetched from the database just like their raw &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#values&#34;&gt;values&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;enum Color : Int {&#xA;

This fatal error can be avoided with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#databasevalue&#34;&gt;DatabaseValue&lt;/a&gt; type:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let row = try Row.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT &#39;syrah&#39;&#34;)!&#xA;&#xA;row[0] as String  // &#34;syrah&#34;&#xA;row[0] as Grape?  // fatal error: could not convert &#34;syrah&#34; to Grape.&#xA;row[0] as Grape   // fatal error: could not convert &#34;syrah&#34; to Grape.&#xA;&#xA;let dbValue: DatabaseValue = row[0]&#xA;if dbValue.isNull {&#xA;    // Handle NULL&#xA;} else if let grape = Grape.fromDatabaseValue(dbValue) {&#xA;    // Handle valid grape&#xA;} else {&#xA;    // Handle unknown grape&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Custom Value Types&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Conversion to and from the database is based on the &lt;code&gt;DatabaseValueConvertible&lt;/code&gt; protocol:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;protocol DatabaseValueConvertible {&#xA;    /// Returns a value that can be stored in the database.&#xA;    var databaseValue: DatabaseValue { get }&#xA;    &#xA;    /// Returns a value initialized from dbValue, if possible.&#xA;    static func fromDatabaseValue(_ dbValue: DatabaseValue) -&amp;gt; Self?&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;All types that adopt this protocol can be used like all other &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#values&#34;&gt;values&lt;/a&gt; (Bool, Int, String, Date, Swift enums, etc.)&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;databaseValue&lt;/code&gt; property returns &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#databasevalue&#34;&gt;DatabaseValue&lt;/a&gt;, a type that wraps the five values supported by SQLite: NULL, Int64, Double, String and Data. Since DatabaseValue has no public initializer, use &lt;code&gt;DatabaseValue.null&lt;/code&gt;, or another type that already adopts the protocol: &lt;code&gt;1.databaseValue&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;&#34;foo&#34;.databaseValue&lt;/code&gt;, etc. Conversion to DatabaseValue &lt;em&gt;must not&lt;/em&gt; fail.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;fromDatabaseValue()&lt;/code&gt; factory method returns an instance of your custom type if the database value contains a suitable value. If the database value does not contain a suitable value, such as &#34;foo&#34; for Date, &lt;code&gt;fromDatabaseValue&lt;/code&gt; &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; return nil (GRDB will interpret this nil result as a conversion error, and react accordingly).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Value types that adopt both &lt;code&gt;DatabaseValueConvertible&lt;/code&gt; and an archival protocol (&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types&#34;&gt;Codable, Encodable or Decodable&lt;/a&gt;) are automatically coded and decoded from JSON arrays and objects:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Encoded as a JSON object in the database:&#xA;struct Color: Codable, DatabaseValueConvertible {&#xA;    var r: Double&#xA;    var g: Double&#xA;    var b: Double&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For such codable value types, GRDB uses the standard &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsondecoder&#34;&gt;JSONDecoder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsonencoder&#34;&gt;JSONEncoder&lt;/a&gt; from Foundation. By default, Data values are handled with the &lt;code&gt;.base64&lt;/code&gt; strategy, Date with the &lt;code&gt;.millisecondsSince1970&lt;/code&gt; strategy, and non conforming floats with the &lt;code&gt;.throw&lt;/code&gt; strategy.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In order to customize the JSON format, provide a custom implementation of the &lt;code&gt;DatabaseValueConvertible&lt;/code&gt; requirements.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: standard sequences such as &lt;code&gt;Array&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;Set&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;Dictionary&lt;/code&gt; do not conform to &lt;code&gt;DatabaseValueConvertible&lt;/code&gt;, even conditionally. You won&#39;t be able to directly fetch or store arrays, sets, or dictionaries as JSON database values. You can get free JSON support from these standard types when they are embedded as properties of &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#codable-records&#34;&gt;Codable Records&lt;/a&gt;, though.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Transactions and Savepoints&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#transactions-and-safety&#34;&gt;Transactions and Safety&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#explicit-transactions&#34;&gt;Explicit Transactions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#savepoints&#34;&gt;Savepoints&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt;

&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;A transaction&lt;/strong&gt; is a fundamental tool of SQLite that guarantees &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/transactional.html&#34;&gt;data consistency&lt;/a&gt; as well as &lt;a href=&#34;https://sqlite.org/isolation.html&#34;&gt;proper isolation&lt;/a&gt; between application threads and database connections.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;GRDB generally opens transactions for you, as a way to enforce its &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/Concurrency.md#safe-and-unsafe-database-accesses&#34;&gt;concurrency guarantees&lt;/a&gt;, and provide maximal security for both your application data and application logic:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// BEGIN TRANSACTION&#xA;// INSERT INTO credit ...&#xA;// INSERT INTO debit ...&#xA;// COMMIT&#xA;try dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    try Credit(destinationAccount, amount).insert(db)&#xA;    try Debit(sourceAccount, amount).insert(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// BEGIN TRANSACTION&#xA;// INSERT INTO credit ...&#xA;// INSERT INTO debit ...&#xA;// COMMIT&#xA;try dbPool.write { db in&#xA;    try Credit(destinationAccount, amount).insert(db)&#xA;    try Debit(sourceAccount, amount).insert(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet you may need to exactly control when transactions take place:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Explicit Transactions&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;DatabaseQueue.inDatabase()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;DatabasePool.writeWithoutTransaction()&lt;/code&gt; execute your database statements outside of any transaction:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// INSERT INTO credit ...&#xA;// INSERT INTO debit ...&#xA;try dbQueue.inDatabase { db in&#xA;    try Credit(destinationAccount, amount).insert(db)&#xA;    try Debit(sourceAccount, amount).insert(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// INSERT INTO credit ...&#xA;// INSERT INTO debit ...&#xA;try dbPool.writeWithoutTransaction { db in&#xA;    try Credit(destinationAccount, amount).insert(db)&#xA;    try Debit(sourceAccount, amount).insert(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Writing outside of any transaction is dangerous,&lt;/strong&gt; for two reasons:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;In our credit/debit example, you may successfully insert a credit, but fail inserting the debit, and end up with unbalanced accounts (oops).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// UNSAFE DATABASE INTEGRITY&#xA;try dbQueue.inDatabase { db in // or dbPool.writeWithoutTransaction&#xA;    try Credit(destinationAccount, amount).insert(db) // may succeed&#xA;    try Debit(sourceAccount, amount).insert(db)      // may fail&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Transactions avoid this kind of bug.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-pools&#34;&gt;Database pool&lt;/a&gt; concurrent reads can see an inconsistent state of the database:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// UNSAFE CONCURRENCY&#xA;try dbPool.writeWithoutTransaction { db in&#xA;    try Credit(destinationAccount, amount).insert(db)&#xA;    // &amp;lt;- Concurrent dbPool.read sees a partial db update here&#xA;    try Debit(sourceAccount, amount).insert(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Transactions avoid this kind of bug, too.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To open explicit transactions, use one of the &lt;code&gt;Database.inTransaction&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;DatabaseQueue.inTransaction&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;DatabasePool.writeInTransaction&lt;/code&gt; methods:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// BEGIN TRANSACTION&#xA;// INSERT INTO credit ...&#xA;// INSERT INTO debit ...&#xA;// COMMIT&#xA;try dbQueue.inDatabase { db in  // or dbPool.writeWithoutTransaction&#xA;    try db.inTransaction {&#xA;        try Credit(destinationAccount, amount).insert(db)&#xA;        try Debit(sourceAccount, amount).insert(db)&#xA;        return .commit&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// BEGIN TRANSACTION&#xA;// INSERT INTO credit ...&#xA;// INSERT INTO debit ...&#xA;// COMMIT&#xA;try dbQueue.inTransaction { db in  // or dbPool.writeInTransaction&#xA;    try Credit(destinationAccount, amount).insert(db)&#xA;    try Debit(sourceAccount, amount).insert(db)&#xA;    return .commit&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If an error is thrown from the transaction block, the transaction is rollbacked and the error is rethrown by the &lt;code&gt;inTransaction&lt;/code&gt; method. If you return &lt;code&gt;.rollback&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;.commit&lt;/code&gt;, the transaction is also rollbacked, but no error is thrown.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also perform manual transaction management:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbQueue.inDatabase { db in  // or dbPool.writeWithoutTransaction&#xA;    try db.beginTransaction()&#xA;    ...&#xA;    try db.commit()&#xA;    &#xA;    try db.execute(sql: &#34;BEGIN TRANSACTION&#34;)&#xA;    ...&#xA;    try db.execute(sql: &#34;ROLLBACK&#34;)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Transactions can&#39;t be left opened unless you set the &lt;a href=&#34;http://groue.github.io/GRDB.swift/docs/5.24/Structs/Configuration.html&#34;&gt;allowsUnsafeTransactions&lt;/a&gt; configuration flag:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// fatal error: A transaction has been left opened at the end of a database access&#xA;try dbQueue.inDatabase { db in&#xA;    try db.execute(sql: &#34;BEGIN TRANSACTION&#34;)&#xA;    // &amp;lt;- no commit or rollback&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can ask if a transaction is currently opened:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;func myCriticalMethod(_ db: Database) throws {&#xA;    precondition(db.isInsideTransaction, &#34;This method requires a transaction&#34;)&#xA;    try ...&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yet, you have a better option than checking for transactions: critical database sections should use savepoints, described below:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;func myCriticalMethod(_ db: Database) throws {&#xA;    try db.inSavepoint {&#xA;        // Here the database is guaranteed to be inside a transaction.&#xA;        try ...&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Savepoints&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Statements grouped in a savepoint can be rollbacked without invalidating a whole transaction:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    // Makes sure both inserts succeed, or none:&#xA;    try db.inSavepoint {&#xA;        try Credit(destinationAccount, amount).insert(db)&#xA;        try Debit(sourceAccount, amount).insert(db)&#xA;        return .commit&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    // Other savepoints, etc...&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If an error is thrown from the savepoint block, the savepoint is rollbacked and the error is rethrown by the &lt;code&gt;inSavepoint&lt;/code&gt; method. If you return &lt;code&gt;.rollback&lt;/code&gt; instead of &lt;code&gt;.commit&lt;/code&gt;, the savepoint is also rollbacked, but no error is thrown.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Unlike transactions, savepoints can be nested.&lt;/strong&gt; They implicitly open a transaction if no one was opened when the savepoint begins. As such, they behave just like nested transactions. Yet the database changes are only written to disk when the outermost transaction is committed:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbQueue.inDatabase { db in&#xA;    try db.inSavepoint {&#xA;        ...&#xA;        try db.inSavepoint {&#xA;            ...&#xA;            return .commit&#xA;        }&#xA;        ...&#xA;        return .commit  // writes changes to disk&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;SQLite savepoints are more than nested transactions, though. For advanced uses, use &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/lang_savepoint.html&#34;&gt;SQLite savepoint documentation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Transaction Kinds&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;SQLite supports &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/lang_transaction.html&#34;&gt;three kinds of transactions&lt;/a&gt;: deferred (the default), immediate, and exclusive.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The transaction kind can be changed in the database configuration, or for each transaction:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// 1) Default configuration:&#xA;let dbQueue = try DatabaseQueue(path: &#34;...&#34;)&#xA;&#xA;// BEGIN DEFERRED TRANSACTION ...&#xA;dbQueue.write { db in ... }&#xA;&#xA;// BEGIN EXCLUSIVE TRANSACTION ...&#xA;dbQueue.inTransaction(.exclusive) { db in ... }&#xA;&#xA;// 2) Customized default transaction kind:&#xA;var config = Configuration()&#xA;config.defaultTransactionKind = .immediate&#xA;let dbQueue = try DatabaseQueue(path: &#34;...&#34;, configuration: config)&#xA;&#xA;// BEGIN IMMEDIATE TRANSACTION ...&#xA;dbQueue.write { db in ... }&#xA;&#xA;// BEGIN EXCLUSIVE TRANSACTION ...&#xA;dbQueue.inTransaction(.exclusive) { db in ... }&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Prepared Statements&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Prepared Statements&lt;/strong&gt; let you prepare an SQL query and execute it later, several times if you need, with different arguments.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    let insertSQL = &#34;INSERT INTO player (name, score) VALUES (:name, :score)&#34;&#xA;    let insertStatement = try db.makeStatement(sql: insertSQL)&#xA;    &#xA;    let selectSQL = &#34;SELECT * FROM player WHERE name = ?&#34;&#xA;    let selectStatement = try db.makeStatement(sql: selectSQL)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; and colon-prefixed keys like &lt;code&gt;:name&lt;/code&gt; in the SQL query are the statement arguments. You set them with arrays or dictionaries (arguments are actually of type &lt;a href=&#34;http://groue.github.io/GRDB.swift/docs/5.24/Structs/StatementArguments.html&#34;&gt;StatementArguments&lt;/a&gt;, which happens to adopt the ExpressibleByArrayLiteral and ExpressibleByDictionaryLiteral protocols).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;insertStatement.arguments = [&#34;name&#34;: &#34;Arthur&#34;, &#34;score&#34;: 1000]&#xA;selectStatement.arguments = [&#34;Arthur&#34;]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, you can create a prepared statement with &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/SQLInterpolation.md&#34;&gt;SQL Interpolation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let insertStatement = try db.makeStatement(literal: &#34;INSERT ...&#34;)&#xA;let selectStatement = try db.makeStatement(literal: &#34;SELECT ...&#34;)&#xA;//                                         ~~~~~~~&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Statements can be executed:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try insertStatement.execute()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Statements can be used wherever a raw SQL query string would fit (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#fetch-queries&#34;&gt;fetch queries&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let rows = try Row.fetchCursor(selectStatement)    // A Cursor of Row&#xA;let players = try Player.fetchAll(selectStatement) // [Player]&#xA;let players = try Player.fetchSet(selectStatement) // Set&amp;lt;Player&amp;gt;&#xA;let player = try Player.fetchOne(selectStatement)  // Player?&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can set the arguments at the moment of the statement execution:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try insertStatement.execute(arguments: [&#34;name&#34;: &#34;Arthur&#34;, &#34;score&#34;: 1000])&#xA;let player = try Player.fetchOne(selectStatement, arguments: [&#34;Arthur&#34;])&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you want to build multiple statements joined with a semicolon&lt;/strong&gt;, use the &lt;code&gt;allStatements&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let statements = try db.allStatements(sql: &#34;&#34;&#34;&#xA;    INSERT INTO player (name, score) VALUES (?, ?);&#xA;    INSERT INTO player (name, score) VALUES (?, ?);&#xA;    &#34;&#34;&#34;, arguments: [&#34;Arthur&#34;, 100, &#34;O&#39;Brien&#34;, 1000])&#xA;while let statement = try statements.next() {&#xA;    try statement.execute()&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;allStatements&lt;/code&gt; also supports &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/SQLInterpolation.md&#34;&gt;SQL Interpolation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let statements = try db.allStatements(literal: &#34;&#34;&#34;&#xA;    INSERT INTO player (name, score) VALUES (\(&#34;Arthur&#34;), \(100));&#xA;    INSERT INTO player (name, score) VALUES (\(&#34;O&#39;Brien&#34;), \(1000));&#xA;    &#34;&#34;&#34;)&#xA;while let statement = try statements.next() {&#xA;    try statement.execute()&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can turn the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#cursors&#34;&gt;cursor&lt;/a&gt; returned from &lt;code&gt;allStatements&lt;/code&gt; into a regular Swift array, but in this case make sure all individual statements can compile even if the previous ones were not run:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// OK: Array of statements&#xA;let statements = try Array(db.allStatements(sql: &#34;&#34;&#34;&#xA;    INSERT ...; &#xA;    UPDATE ...; &#xA;    SELECT ...;&#xA;    &#34;&#34;&#34;))&#xA;&#xA;// FAILURE: Can&#39;t build an array of statements since &#xA;// the INSERT won&#39;t compile until CREATE TABLE is run.&#xA;let statements = try Array(db.allStatements(sql: &#34;&#34;&#34;&#xA;    CREATE TABLE player ...; &#xA;    INSERT INTO player ...;&#xA;    &#34;&#34;&#34;))&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;code&gt;Database.execute(sql:)&lt;/code&gt; in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#executing-updates&#34;&gt;Executing Updates&lt;/a&gt; chapter.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: it is a programmer error to reuse a prepared statement that has failed: GRDB may crash if you do so.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more information about prepared statements, see the &lt;a href=&#34;http://groue.github.io/GRDB.swift/docs/5.24/Classes/Statement.html&#34;&gt;Statement reference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Prepared Statements Cache&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the same query will be used several times in the lifetime of your application, you may feel a natural desire to cache prepared statements.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Don&#39;t cache statements yourself.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: This is because you don&#39;t have the necessary tools. Statements are tied to specific SQLite connections and dispatch queues which you don&#39;t manage yourself, especially when you use &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-pools&#34;&gt;database pools&lt;/a&gt;. A change in the database schema &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/compile.html#max_schema_retry&#34;&gt;may, or may not&lt;/a&gt; invalidate a statement.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, use the &lt;code&gt;cachedStatement&lt;/code&gt; method. GRDB does all the hard caching and &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#memory-management&#34;&gt;memory management&lt;/a&gt; stuff for you:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let statement = try db.cachedStatement(sql: sql)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Cached statements also support &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/SQLInterpolation.md&#34;&gt;SQL Interpolation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let statement = try db.cachedStatement(literal: &#34;INSERT ...&#34;)&#xA;//                                     ~~~~~~~&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;⚠&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt;: Should a cached prepared statement throw an error, don&#39;t reuse it (it is a programmer error). Instead, reload one from the cache.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Custom SQL Functions and Aggregates&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQLite lets you define SQL functions and aggregates.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;A custom SQL function or aggregate extends SQLite:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;SELECT reverse(name) FROM player;   -- custom function&#xA;SELECT maxLength(name) FROM player; -- custom aggregate&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#custom-sql-functions&#34;&gt;Custom SQL Functions&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#custom-aggregates&#34;&gt;Custom Aggregates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Custom SQL Functions&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;em&gt;function&lt;/em&gt; argument takes an array of &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#databasevalue&#34;&gt;DatabaseValue&lt;/a&gt;, and returns any valid &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#values&#34;&gt;value&lt;/a&gt; (Bool, Int, String, Date, Swift enums, etc.) The number of database values is guaranteed to be &lt;em&gt;argumentCount&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;SQLite has the opportunity to perform additional optimizations when functions are &#34;pure&#34;, which means that their result only depends on their arguments. So make sure to set the &lt;em&gt;pure&lt;/em&gt; argument to true when possible.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let reverse = DatabaseFunction(&#34;reverse&#34;, argumentCount: 1, pure: true) { (values: [DatabaseValue]) in&#xA;    // Extract string value, if any...&#xA;    guard let string = String.fromDatabaseValue(values[0]) else {&#xA;        return nil&#xA;    }&#xA;    // ... and return reversed string:&#xA;    return String(string.reversed())&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You make a function available to a database connection through its configuration:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;var config = Configuration()&#xA;config.prepareDatabase { db in&#xA;    db.add(function: reverse)&#xA;}&#xA;let dbQueue = try DatabaseQueue(path: dbPath, configuration: config)&#xA;&#xA;try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    // &#34;oof&#34;&#xA;    try String.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT reverse(&#39;foo&#39;)&#34;)!&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functions can take a variable number of arguments:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you don&#39;t provide any explicit &lt;em&gt;argumentCount&lt;/em&gt;, the function can take any number of arguments:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let averageOf = DatabaseFunction(&#34;averageOf&#34;, pure: true) { (values: [DatabaseValue]) in&#xA;    let doubles = values.compactMap { Double.fromDatabaseValue($0) }&#xA;    return doubles.reduce(0, +) / Double(doubles.count)&#xA;}&#xA;db.add(function: averageOf)&#xA;&#xA;// 2.0&#xA;try Double.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT averageOf(1, 2, 3)&#34;)!&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Functions can throw:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let sqrt = DatabaseFunction(&#34;sqrt&#34;, argumentCount: 1, pure: true) { (values: [DatabaseValue]) in&#xA;    guard let double = Double.fromDatabaseValue(values[0]) else {&#xA;        return nil&#xA;    }&#xA;    guard double &amp;gt;= 0 else {&#xA;        throw DatabaseError(message: &#34;invalid negative number&#34;)&#xA;    }&#xA;    return sqrt(double)&#xA;}&#xA;db.add(function: sqrt)&#xA;&#xA;// SQLite error 1 with statement `SELECT sqrt(-1)`: invalid negative number&#xA;try Double.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT sqrt(-1)&#34;)!&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use custom functions in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#the-query-interface&#34;&gt;query interface&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// SELECT reverseString(&#34;name&#34;) FROM player&#xA;Player.select(reverseString(nameColumn))&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRDB ships with built-in SQL functions that perform unicode-aware string transformations.&lt;/strong&gt; See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#unicode&#34;&gt;Unicode&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Custom Aggregates&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Before registering a custom aggregate, you need to define a type that adopts the &lt;code&gt;DatabaseAggregate&lt;/code&gt; protocol:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;protocol DatabaseAggregate {&#xA;    // Initializes an aggregate&#xA;    init()&#xA;    &#xA;    // Called at each step of the aggregation&#xA;    mutating func step(_ dbValues: [DatabaseValue]) throws&#xA;    &#xA;    // Returns the final result&#xA;    func finalize() throws -&amp;gt; DatabaseValueConvertible?&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct MaxLength : DatabaseAggregate {&#xA;    var maxLength: Int = 0&#xA;    &#xA;    mutating func step(_ dbValues: [DatabaseValue]) {&#xA;        // At each step, extract string value, if any...&#xA;        guard let string = String.fromDatabaseValue(dbValues[0]) else {&#xA;            return&#xA;        }&#xA;        // ... and update the result&#xA;        let length = string.count&#xA;        if length &amp;gt; maxLength {&#xA;            maxLength = length&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    func finalize() -&amp;gt; DatabaseValueConvertible?

This array contains as many values as the &lt;em&gt;argumentCount&lt;/em&gt; parameter (or any number of values, when &lt;em&gt;argumentCount&lt;/em&gt; is omitted).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;finalize&lt;/code&gt; method of the aggregate returns the final aggregated &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#values&#34;&gt;value&lt;/a&gt; (Bool, Int, String, Date, Swift enums, etc.).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;SQLite has the opportunity to perform additional optimizations when aggregates are &#34;pure&#34;, which means that their result only depends on their inputs. So make sure to set the &lt;em&gt;pure&lt;/em&gt; argument to true when possible.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Use custom aggregates in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#the-query-interface&#34;&gt;query interface&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// SELECT maxLength(&#34;name&#34;) FROM player&#xA;let request = Player.select(maxLength.apply(nameColumn))&#xA;try Int.fetchOne(db, request) // Int?&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Database Schema Introspection&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;GRDB comes with a set of schema introspection methods:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    // Bool, true if the table exists&#xA;    try db.tableExists(&#34;player&#34;)&#xA;    &#xA;    // [ColumnInfo], the columns in the table&#xA;    try db.columns(in: &#34;player&#34;)&#xA;    &#xA;    // PrimaryKeyInfo&#xA;    try db.primaryKey(&#34;player&#34;)&#xA;    &#xA;    // [ForeignKeyInfo], the foreign keys defined on the table&#xA;    try db.foreignKeys(on: &#34;player&#34;)&#xA;    &#xA;    // [IndexInfo], the indexes defined on the table&#xA;    try db.indexes(on: &#34;player&#34;)&#xA;    &#xA;    // Bool, true if column(s) is a unique key (primary key or unique index)&#xA;    try db.table(&#34;player&#34;, hasUniqueKey: [&#34;email&#34;])&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// Bool, true if argument is the name of an internal SQLite table&#xA;Database.isSQLiteInternalTable(...)&#xA;&#xA;// Bool, true if argument is the name of an internal GRDB table&#xA;Database.isGRDBInternalTable(...)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Row Adapters&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Row adapters let you present database rows in the way expected by the row consumers.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;They basically help two incompatible row interfaces to work together. For example, a row consumer expects a column named &#34;consumed&#34;, but the produced row has a column named &#34;produced&#34;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this case, the &lt;code&gt;ColumnMapping&lt;/code&gt; row adapter comes in handy:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Turn the &#39;produced&#39; column into &#39;consumed&#39;:&#xA;let adapter = ColumnMapping([&#34;consumed&#34;: &#34;produced&#34;])&#xA;let row = try Row.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT &#39;Hello&#39; AS produced&#34;, adapter: adapter)!&#xA;&#xA;// [consumed:&#34;Hello&#34;]&#xA;print(row)&#xA;&#xA;// &#34;Hello&#34;&#xA;print(row[&#34;consumed&#34;])&#xA;&#xA;// ▿ [consumed:&#34;Hello&#34;]&#xA;//   unadapted: [produced:&#34;Hello&#34;]&#xA;print(row.debugDescription)&#xA;&#xA;// [produced:&#34;Hello&#34;]&#xA;print(row.unadapted)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#records&#34;&gt;Record types&lt;/a&gt; are typical row consumers that expect database rows to have a specific layout so that they can decode them:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct MyRecord: Decodable, FetchableRecord {&#xA;    var consumed: String&#xA;}&#xA;let record = try MyRecord.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT &#39;Hello&#39; AS produced&#34;, adapter: adapter)!&#xA;print(record.consumed) // &#34;Hello&#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;There are several situations where row adapters are useful:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;They help disambiguate columns with identical names, which may happen when you select columns from several tables. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#joined-queries-support&#34;&gt;Joined Queries Support&lt;/a&gt; for an example.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;They help when SQLite outputs unexpected column names, which may happen with some subqueries.

Build one with a dictionary whose keys are adapted column names, and values the column names in the raw row:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// [newA:0, newB:1]&#xA;let adapter = ColumnMapping([&#34;newA&#34;: &#34;a&#34;, &#34;newB&#34;: &#34;b&#34;])&#xA;let row = try Row.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT 0 AS a, 1 AS b, 2 AS c&#34;, adapter: adapter)!&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that columns that are not present in the dictionary are not present in the resulting adapted row.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;EmptyRowAdapter&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;EmptyRowAdapter&lt;/code&gt; hides all columns.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let adapter = EmptyRowAdapter()&#xA;let row = try Row.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT 0 AS a, 1 AS b, 2 AS c&#34;, adapter: adapter)!&#xA;row.isEmpty // true&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This limit adapter may turn out useful in some narrow use cases. You&#39;ll be happy to find it when you need it.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;RangeRowAdapter&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RangeRowAdapter&lt;/code&gt; only exposes a range of columns.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// [b:1]&#xA;let adapter = RangeRowAdapter(1..&amp;lt;2)&#xA;let row = try Row.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT 0 AS a, 1 AS b, 2 AS c&#34;, adapter: adapter)!&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;RenameColumnAdapter&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;RenameColumnAdapter&lt;/code&gt; lets you transform column names with a function:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// [arrr:0, brrr:1, crrr:2]&#xA;let adapter = RenameColumnAdapter { column in column + &#34;rrr&#34; }&#xA;let row = try Row.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT 0 AS a, 1 AS b, 2 AS c&#34;, adapter: adapter)!&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This adapter may turn out useful, for example, when subqueries contain duplicated column names:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let sql = &#34;SELECT * FROM (SELECT 1 AS id, 2 AS id)&#34;&#xA;&#xA;// Prints [&#34;id&#34;, &#34;id:1&#34;]&#xA;// Note the &#34;id:1&#34; column, generated by SQLite.&#xA;let row = try Row.fetchOne(db, sql: sql)!&#xA;print(Array(row.columnNames))&#xA;&#xA;// Drop the `:...` suffix, and prints [&#34;id&#34;, &#34;id&#34;]&#xA;let adapter = RenameColumnAdapter { String($0.prefix(while: { $0 != &#34;:&#34; })) }&#xA;let adaptedRow = try Row.fetchOne(db, sql: sql, adapter: adapter)!&#xA;print(Array(adaptedRow.columnNames))&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;ScopeAdapter&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;ScopeAdapter&lt;/code&gt; defines &lt;em&gt;row scopes&lt;/em&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let adapter = ScopeAdapter([&#xA;    &#34;left&#34;: RangeRowAdapter(0..&amp;lt;2),&#xA;    &#34;right&#34;: RangeRowAdapter(2..&amp;lt;4)])&#xA;let row = try Row.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT 0 AS a, 1 AS b, 2 AS c, 3 AS d&#34;, adapter: adapter)!&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;ScopeAdapter does not change the columns and values of the fetched row.

Make sure you touch raw databases and statements inside their dedicated dispatch queues.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;  &lt;li&gt;Use the raw SQLite C Interface at your own risk. GRDB won&#39;t prevent you from shooting yourself in the foot.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Records&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;On top of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#sqlite-api&#34;&gt;SQLite API&lt;/a&gt;, GRDB provides protocols and a class&lt;/strong&gt; that help manipulating database rows as regular objects named &#34;records&#34;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    if var place = try Place.fetchOne(db, id: 1) {&#xA;        place.isFavorite = true&#xA;        try place.update(db)&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Of course, you need to open a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-connections&#34;&gt;database connection&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-schema&#34;&gt;create database tables&lt;/a&gt; first.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To define your custom records, you subclass the ready-made &lt;code&gt;Record&lt;/code&gt; class, or you extend your structs and classes with protocols that come with focused sets of features: fetching methods, persistence methods, record comparison...&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Extending structs with record protocols is more &#34;swifty&#34;. Subclassing the Record class is more &#34;classic&#34;. You can choose either way. See some &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#examples-of-record-definitions&#34;&gt;examples of record definitions&lt;/a&gt;, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#list-of-record-methods&#34;&gt;list of record methods&lt;/a&gt; for an overview.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: if you are familiar with Core Data&#39;s NSManagedObject or Realm&#39;s Object, you may experience a cultural shock: GRDB records are not uniqued, do not auto-update, and do not lazy-load. This is both a purpose, and a consequence of protocol-oriented programming.

For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct Place {&#xA;    var id: Int64?&#xA;    var title: String&#xA;    var coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;extension Place : FetchableRecord {&#xA;    init(row: Row) {&#xA;        id = row[&#34;id&#34;]&#xA;        title = row[&#34;title&#34;]&#xA;        coordinate = CLLocationCoordinate2D(&#xA;            latitude: row[&#34;latitude&#34;],&#xA;            longitude: row[&#34;longitude&#34;])&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Rows also accept column enums:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;extension Place : FetchableRecord {&#xA;    enum Columns: String, ColumnExpression {&#xA;        case id, title, latitude, longitude&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    init(row: Row) {&#xA;        id = row[Columns.id]&#xA;        title = row[Columns.title]&#xA;        coordinate = CLLocationCoordinate2D(&#xA;            latitude: row[Columns.latitude],&#xA;            longitude: row[Columns.longitude])&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#column-values&#34;&gt;column values&lt;/a&gt; for more information about the &lt;code&gt;row[]&lt;/code&gt; subscript.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When your record type adopts the standard Decodable protocol, you don&#39;t have to provide the implementation for &lt;code&gt;init(row:)&lt;/code&gt;. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#codable-records&#34;&gt;Codable Records&lt;/a&gt; for more information:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// That&#39;s all&#xA;struct Player: Decodable, FetchableRecord {&#xA;    var id: Int64&#xA;    var name: String&#xA;    var score: Int&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;FetchableRecord allows adopting types to be fetched from SQL queries:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try Place.fetchCursor(db, sql: &#34;SELECT ...&#34;, arguments:...) // A Cursor of Place&#xA;try Place.fetchAll(db, sql: &#34;SELECT ...&#34;, arguments:...)    // [Place]&#xA;try Place.fetchSet(db, sql: &#34;SELECT ...&#34;, arguments:...)    // Set&amp;lt;Place&amp;gt;&#xA;try Place.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT ...&#34;, arguments:...)    // Place?&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#fetching-methods&#34;&gt;fetching methods&lt;/a&gt; for information about the &lt;code&gt;fetchCursor&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fetchAll&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fetchSet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fetchOne&lt;/code&gt; methods.

If you want to keep the row for later use, make sure to store a copy: &lt;code&gt;self.row = row.copy()&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;code&gt;FetchableRecord.init(row:)&lt;/code&gt; initializer fits the needs of most applications. But some application are more demanding than others. When FetchableRecord does not exactly provide the support you need, have a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#beyond-fetchablerecord&#34;&gt;Beyond FetchableRecord&lt;/a&gt; chapter.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;TableRecord Protocol&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The TableRecord protocol&lt;/strong&gt; generates SQL for you. To use TableRecord, subclass the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#record-class&#34;&gt;Record&lt;/a&gt; class, or adopt it explicitly:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;protocol TableRecord {&#xA;    static var databaseTableName: String { get }&#xA;    static var databaseSelection: [SQLSelectable] { get }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;databaseSelection&lt;/code&gt; type property is optional, and documented in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#columns-selected-by-a-request&#34;&gt;Columns Selected by a Request&lt;/a&gt; chapter.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;databaseTableName&lt;/code&gt; type property is the name of a database table. By default, it is derived from the type name:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct Place: TableRecord { }&#xA;print(Place.databaseTableName) // prints &#34;place&#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Place: &lt;code&gt;place&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Country: &lt;code&gt;country&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;PostalAddress: &lt;code&gt;postalAddress&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;HTTPRequest: &lt;code&gt;httpRequest&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;TOEFL: &lt;code&gt;toefl&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can still provide a custom table name:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct Place: TableRecord {&#xA;    static let databaseTableName = &#34;location&#34;&#xA;}&#xA;print(Place.databaseTableName) // prints &#34;location&#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Subclasses of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#record-class&#34;&gt;Record&lt;/a&gt; class must always override their superclass&#39;s &lt;code&gt;databaseTableName&lt;/code&gt; property:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;class Place: Record {&#xA;    override class var databaseTableName: String { &#34;place&#34; }&#xA;}&#xA;print(Place.databaseTableName) // prints &#34;place&#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When a type adopts both TableRecord and &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#fetchablerecord-protocol&#34;&gt;FetchableRecord&lt;/a&gt;, it can be fetched using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#the-query-interface&#34;&gt;query interface&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// SELECT * FROM place WHERE name = &#39;Paris&#39;&#xA;let paris = try Place.filter(nameColumn == &#34;Paris&#34;).fetchOne(db)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;TableRecord can also fetch deal with primary and unique keys: see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#fetching-by-key&#34;&gt;Fetching by Key&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#testing-for-record-existence&#34;&gt;Testing for Record Existence&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;PersistableRecord Protocol&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRDB record types can create, update, and delete rows in the database.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those abilities are granted by three protocols:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Defines how a record encodes itself into the database&#xA;protocol EncodableRecord {&#xA;    /// Defines the values persisted in the database&#xA;    func encode(to container: inout PersistenceContainer)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// Adds persistence methods&#xA;protocol MutablePersistableRecord: TableRecord, EncodableRecord {&#xA;    /// Optional method that lets your adopting type store its rowID upon&#xA;    /// successful insertion. Don&#39;t call it directly: it is called for you.&#xA;    mutating func didInsert(with rowID: Int64, for column: String?)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// Adds immutability&#xA;protocol PersistableRecord: MutablePersistableRecord {&#xA;    /// Non-mutating version of the optional didInsert(with:for:)&#xA;    func didInsert(with rowID: Int64, for column: String?)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Yes, three protocols instead of one. Here is how you pick one or the other:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If your type is a class&lt;/strong&gt;, choose &lt;code&gt;PersistableRecord&lt;/code&gt;. On top of that, implement &lt;code&gt;didInsert(with:for:)&lt;/code&gt; if the database table has an auto-incremented primary key.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;If your type is a struct, and the database table has an auto-incremented primary key&lt;/strong&gt;, choose &lt;code&gt;MutablePersistableRecord&lt;/code&gt;, and implement &lt;code&gt;didInsert(with:for:)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Otherwise&lt;/strong&gt;, choose &lt;code&gt;PersistableRecord&lt;/code&gt;, and ignore &lt;code&gt;didInsert(with:for:)&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;encode(to:)&lt;/code&gt; method defines which &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#values&#34;&gt;values&lt;/a&gt; (Bool, Int, String, Date, Swift enums, etc.) are assigned to database columns.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The optional &lt;code&gt;didInsert&lt;/code&gt; method lets the adopting type store its rowID after successful insertion, and is only useful for tables that have an auto-incremented primary key. It is called from a protected dispatch queue, and serialized with all database updates.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To use the persistable protocols&lt;/strong&gt;, subclass the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#record-class&#34;&gt;Record&lt;/a&gt; class, or adopt one of them explicitly. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;extension Place : MutablePersistableRecord {&#xA;    /// The values persisted in the database&#xA;    func encode(to container: inout PersistenceContainer) {&#xA;        container[&#34;id&#34;] = id&#xA;        container[&#34;title&#34;] = title&#xA;        container[&#34;latitude&#34;] = coordinate.latitude&#xA;        container[&#34;longitude&#34;] = coordinate.longitude&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    // Update auto-incremented id upon successful insertion&#xA;    mutating func didInsert(with rowID: Int64, for column: String?) {&#xA;        id = rowID&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;var paris = Place(&#xA;    id: nil,&#xA;    title: &#34;Paris&#34;,&#xA;    coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D(latitude: 48.8534100, longitude: 2.3488000))&#xA;&#xA;try paris.insert(db)&#xA;paris.id   // some value&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Persistence containers also accept column enums:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;extension Place : MutablePersistableRecord {&#xA;    enum Columns: String, ColumnExpression {&#xA;        case id, title, latitude, longitude&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    func encode(to container: inout PersistenceContainer) {&#xA;        container[Columns.id] = id&#xA;        container[Columns.title] = title&#xA;        container[Columns.latitude] = coordinate.latitude&#xA;        container[Columns.longitude] = coordinate.longitude&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When your record type adopts the standard Encodable protocol, you don&#39;t have to provide the implementation for &lt;code&gt;encode(to:)&lt;/code&gt;. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#codable-records&#34;&gt;Codable Records&lt;/a&gt; for more information:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// That&#39;s all&#xA;struct Player: Encodable, MutablePersistableRecord {&#xA;    var id: Int64?&#xA;    var name: String&#xA;    var score: Int&#xA;    &#xA;    // Update auto-incremented id upon successful insertion&#xA;    mutating func didInsert(with rowID: Int64, for column: String?) {&#xA;        id = rowID&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Persistence Methods&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#record-class&#34;&gt;Record&lt;/a&gt; subclasses and types that adopt &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#persistablerecord-protocol&#34;&gt;PersistableRecord&lt;/a&gt; are given default implementations for methods that insert, update, and delete:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// INSERT&#xA;try place.insert(db)&#xA;let insertedPlace = try place.inserted(db) // non-mutating&#xA;&#xA;// UPDATE&#xA;try place.update(db)&#xA;try place.update(db, columns: [&#34;title&#34;])&#xA;&#xA;// Maybe UPDATE&#xA;try place.updateChanges(db, from: otherPlace)&#xA;try place.updateChanges(db) { $0.isFavorite = true }&#xA;try place.updateChanges(db) // Record class only&#xA;&#xA;// INSERT or UPDATE&#xA;try place.save(db)&#xA;let savedPlace = place.saved(db) // non-mutating&#xA;&#xA;// DELETE&#xA;try place.delete(db)&#xA;&#xA;// EXISTENCE CHECK&#xA;let exists = try place.exists(db)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#tablerecord-protocol&#34;&gt;TableRecord&lt;/a&gt; protocol comes with batch operations:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// UPDATE&#xA;try Place.updateAll(db, ...)&#xA;&#xA;// DELETE&#xA;try Place.deleteAll(db)&#xA;try Place.deleteAll(db, ids:...)&#xA;try Place.deleteAll(db, keys:...)&#xA;try Place.deleteOne(db, id:...)&#xA;try Place.deleteOne(db, key:...)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;All those methods can throw a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#error-handling&#34;&gt;DatabaseError&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;updateChanges&lt;/code&gt; throw &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#persistenceerror&#34;&gt;PersistenceError&lt;/a&gt; if the database does not contain any row for the primary key of the record.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;save&lt;/code&gt; makes sure your values are stored in the database. It performs an UPDATE if the record has a non-null primary key, and then, if no row was modified, an INSERT. It directly performs an INSERT if the record has no primary key, or a null primary key.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;delete&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;deleteOne&lt;/code&gt; returns whether a database row was deleted or not. &lt;code&gt;deleteAll&lt;/code&gt; returns the number of deleted rows. &lt;code&gt;updateAll&lt;/code&gt; returns the number of updated rows. &lt;code&gt;updateChanges&lt;/code&gt; returns whether a database row was updated or not.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All primary keys are supported&lt;/strong&gt;, including composite primary keys that span several columns, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#the-implicit-rowid-primary-key&#34;&gt;implicit rowid primary key&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Customizing the Persistence Methods&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your custom type may want to perform extra work when the persistence methods are invoked.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, it may want to have its UUID automatically set before inserting. Or it may want to validate its values before saving.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you subclass &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#record-class&#34;&gt;Record&lt;/a&gt;, you simply have to override the customized method, and call &lt;code&gt;super&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;class Player : Record {&#xA;    var uuid: UUID?&#xA;    &#xA;    override func insert(_ db: Database) throws {&#xA;        if uuid == nil {&#xA;            uuid = UUID()&#xA;        }&#xA;        try super.insert(db)&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you use the raw &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#persistablerecord-protocol&#34;&gt;PersistableRecord&lt;/a&gt; protocol, use one of the &lt;em&gt;special methods&lt;/em&gt; &lt;code&gt;performInsert&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;performUpdate&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;performSave&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;performDelete&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;performExists&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct Link : PersistableRecord {&#xA;    var url: URL&#xA;    &#xA;    func insert(_ db: Database) throws {&#xA;        try validate()&#xA;        try performInsert(db)&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    func update(_ db: Database, columns: Set&amp;lt;String&amp;gt;) throws {&#xA;        try validate()&#xA;        try performUpdate(db, columns: columns)&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    func validate() throws {&#xA;        if url.host == nil {&#xA;            throw ValidationError(&#34;url must be absolute.&#34;)&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: the special methods &lt;code&gt;performInsert&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;performUpdate&lt;/code&gt;, etc. are reserved for your custom implementations. Do not use them elsewhere. Do not provide another implementation for those methods.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: it is recommended that you do not implement your own version of the &lt;code&gt;save&lt;/code&gt; method. Its default implementation forwards the job to &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;insert&lt;/code&gt;: these are the methods that may need customization, not &lt;code&gt;save&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Identifiable Records&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When a record type maps a table with a single-column primary key, it is recommended to have it adopt the standard &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swift/identifiable&#34;&gt;Identifiable&lt;/a&gt; protocol.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct Player: Identifiable, FetchableRecord, PersistableRecord {&#xA;    var id: Int64 // fulfills the Identifiable requirement&#xA;    var name: String&#xA;    var score: Int&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; has a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#values&#34;&gt;database-compatible type&lt;/a&gt; (Int64, Int, String, UUID, ...), the &lt;code&gt;Identifiable&lt;/code&gt; conformance unlocks type-safe record and request methods:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let player = try Player.fetchOne(db, id: 1)&#xA;let players = try Player.fetchAll(db, ids: [1, 2, 3])&#xA;let players = try Player.fetchSet(db, ids: [1, 2, 3])&#xA;&#xA;let request = Player.filter(id: 1)&#xA;let request = Player.filter(ids: [1, 2, 3])&#xA;&#xA;let ids = try Player.selectID().fetchAll(db)&#xA;let ids = try Player.filter(...).selectID().fetchSet(db)&#xA;&#xA;try Player.deleteOne(db, id: 1)&#xA;try Player.deleteAll(db, ids: [1, 2, 3])&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;Identifiable&lt;/code&gt; is not available on all application targets, and not all tables have a single-column primary key. GRDB provides other methods that deal with primary and unique keys, but they won&#39;t check the type of their arguments:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Those methods are not type-checked&#xA;try Player.fetchOne(db, key: 1)&#xA;try Player.fetchOne(db, key: [&#34;email&#34;: &#34;arthur@example.com&#34;])&#xA;try Country.fetchAll(db, keys: [&#34;FR&#34;, &#34;US&#34;])&#xA;try Citizenship.fetchOne(db, key: [&#34;citizenId&#34;: 1, &#34;countryCode&#34;: &#34;FR&#34;])&#xA;&#xA;let request = Player.filter(key: 1)&#xA;let request = Player.filter(keys: [1, 2, 3])&#xA;&#xA;try Player.deleteOne(db, key: 1)&#xA;try Player.deleteAll(db, keys: [1, 2, 3])&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some database tables have a single-column primary key which is not called &#34;id&#34;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try db.create(table: &#34;country&#34;) { t in&#xA;    t.column(&#34;isoCode&#34;, .text).notNull().primaryKey()&#xA;    t.column(&#34;name&#34;, .text).notNull()&#xA;    t.column(&#34;population&#34;, .integer).notNull()&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this case, &lt;code&gt;Identifiable&lt;/code&gt; conformance can be achieved, for example, by returning the primary key column from the &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; property:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct Country: Identifiable, FetchableRecord, PersistableRecord {&#xA;    var isoCode: String&#xA;    var name: String&#xA;    var population: Int&#xA;    &#xA;    // Fulfill the Identifiable requirement&#xA;    var id: String { isoCode }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;let france = try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    try Country.fetchOne(db, id: &#34;FR&#34;)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Codable Records&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Record types that adopt an archival protocol (&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types&#34;&gt;Codable, Encodable or Decodable&lt;/a&gt;) get free database support just by declaring conformance to the desired &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#record-protocols-overview&#34;&gt;record protocols&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Declare a record...&#xA;struct Player: Codable, FetchableRecord, PersistableRecord {&#xA;    var name: String&#xA;    var score: Int&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// ...and there you go:&#xA;try dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    try Player(name: &#34;Arthur&#34;, score: 100).insert(db)&#xA;    let players = try Player.fetchAll(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Codable records encode and decode their properties according to their own implementation of the Encodable and Decodable protocols. Yet databases have specific requirements:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Properties are always coded according to their preferred database representation, when they have one (all &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#values&#34;&gt;values&lt;/a&gt; that adopt the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#custom-value-types&#34;&gt;DatabaseValueConvertible&lt;/a&gt; protocol).&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;You can customize the encoding and decoding of dates and uuids.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Complex properties (arrays, dictionaries, nested structs, etc.) are stored as JSON.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more information about Codable records, see:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#json-columns&#34;&gt;JSON Columns&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#column-names-coding-strategies&#34;&gt;Column Names Coding Strategies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#date-and-uuid-coding-strategies&#34;&gt;Date and UUID Coding Strategies&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#the-userinfo-dictionary&#34;&gt;The userInfo Dictionary&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#tip-derive-columns-from-coding-keys&#34;&gt;Tip: Derive Columns from Coding Keys&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/DemoApps&#34;&gt;Demo Applications&lt;/a&gt; for sample code that uses Codable records.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;JSON Columns&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#codable-records&#34;&gt;Codable record&lt;/a&gt; contains a property that is not a simple &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#values&#34;&gt;value&lt;/a&gt; (Bool, Int, String, Date, Swift enums, etc.), that value is encoded and decoded as a &lt;strong&gt;JSON string&lt;/strong&gt;. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;enum AchievementColor: String, Codable {&#xA;    case bronze, silver, gold&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;struct Achievement: Codable {&#xA;    var name: String&#xA;    var color: AchievementColor&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;struct Player: Codable, FetchableRecord, PersistableRecord {&#xA;    var name: String&#xA;    var score: Int&#xA;    var achievements: [Achievement] // stored in a JSON column&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;try! dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    // INSERT INTO player (name, score, achievements)&#xA;    // VALUES (&#xA;    //   &#39;Arthur&#39;,&#xA;    //   100,&#xA;    //   &#39;[{&#34;color&#34;:&#34;gold&#34;,&#34;name&#34;:&#34;Use Codable Records&#34;}]&#39;)&#xA;    let achievement = Achievement(name: &#34;Use Codable Records&#34;, color: .gold)&#xA;    let player = Player(name: &#34;Arthur&#34;, score: 100, achievements: [achievement])&#xA;    try player.insert(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;GRDB uses the standard &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsondecoder&#34;&gt;JSONDecoder&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/jsonencoder&#34;&gt;JSONEncoder&lt;/a&gt; from Foundation. By default, Data values are handled with the &lt;code&gt;.base64&lt;/code&gt; strategy, Date with the &lt;code&gt;.millisecondsSince1970&lt;/code&gt; strategy, and non conforming floats with the &lt;code&gt;.throw&lt;/code&gt; strategy.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can customize the JSON format by implementing those methods:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;protocol FetchableRecord {&#xA;    static func databaseJSONDecoder(for column: String) -&amp;gt; JSONDecoder&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;protocol EncodableRecord {&#xA;    static func databaseJSONEncoder(for column: String) -&amp;gt; JSONEncoder&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Make sure you set the JSONEncoder &lt;code&gt;sortedKeys&lt;/code&gt; option, available from iOS 11.0+, macOS 10.13+, tvOS 9.0+ and watchOS 4.0+. This option makes sure that the JSON output is stable. This stability is required for &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#record-comparison&#34;&gt;Record Comparison&lt;/a&gt; to work as expected, and database observation tools such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservation&#34;&gt;ValueObservation&lt;/a&gt; to accurately recognize changed records.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Column Names Coding Strategies&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;By default, &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#codable-records&#34;&gt;Codable Records&lt;/a&gt; store their values into database columns that match their coding keys: the &lt;code&gt;teamID&lt;/code&gt; property is stored into the &lt;code&gt;teamID&lt;/code&gt; column.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This behavior can be overridden, so that you can, for example, store the &lt;code&gt;teamID&lt;/code&gt; property into the &lt;code&gt;team_id&lt;/code&gt; column:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;protocol FetchableRecord {&#xA;    static var databaseColumnDecodingStrategy: DatabaseColumnDecodingStrategy { get }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;protocol EncodableRecord {&#xA;    static var databaseColumnEncodingStrategy: DatabaseColumnEncodingStrategy { get }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://groue.github.io/GRDB.swift/docs/5.24/Enums/DatabaseColumnDecodingStrategy.html&#34;&gt;DatabaseColumnDecodingStrategy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://groue.github.io/GRDB.swift/docs/5.24/Enums/DatabaseColumnEncodingStrategy.html&#34;&gt;DatabaseColumnEncodingStrategy&lt;/a&gt; to learn about all available strategies.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Date and UUID Coding Strategies&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;By default, &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#codable-records&#34;&gt;Codable Records&lt;/a&gt; encode and decode their Date and UUID properties as described in the general &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#date-and-datecomponents&#34;&gt;Date and DateComponents&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#uuid&#34;&gt;UUID&lt;/a&gt; chapters.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To sum up: dates encode themselves in the &#34;YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS.SSS&#34; format, in the UTC time zone, and decode a variety of date formats and timestamps. UUIDs encode themselves as 16-bytes data blobs, and decode both 16-bytes data blobs and strings such as &#34;E621E1F8-C36C-495A-93FC-0C247A3E6E5F&#34;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those behaviors can be overridden:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;protocol FetchableRecord {&#xA;    static var databaseDateDecodingStrategy: DatabaseDateDecodingStrategy { get }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;protocol EncodableRecord {&#xA;    static var databaseDateEncodingStrategy: DatabaseDateEncodingStrategy { get }&#xA;    static var databaseUUIDEncodingStrategy: DatabaseUUIDEncodingStrategy { get }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://groue.github.io/GRDB.swift/docs/5.24/Enums/DatabaseDateDecodingStrategy.html&#34;&gt;DatabaseDateDecodingStrategy&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://groue.github.io/GRDB.swift/docs/5.24/Enums/DatabaseDateEncodingStrategy.html&#34;&gt;DatabaseDateEncodingStrategy&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;https://groue.github.io/GRDB.swift/docs/5.24/Enums/DatabaseUUIDEncodingStrategy.html&#34;&gt;DatabaseUUIDEncodingStrategy&lt;/a&gt; to learn about all available strategies.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is no customization of uuid decoding, because UUID can already decode all its encoded variants (16-bytes blobs and uuid strings, both uppercase and lowercase).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Customized date and uuid handling apply:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;When encoding and decoding database rows to and from records (fetching and persistence methods).&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;In requests by single-column primary key: &lt;code&gt;fetchOne(_&lt;span&gt;🆔&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;filter(id:)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;deleteAll(_:keys:)&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;They do not apply&lt;/em&gt; in other requests based on date or uuid values.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;So make sure that dates and uuids are properly encoded in your requests. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct Player: Codable, FetchableRecord, PersistableRecord, Identifiable {&#xA;    // UUIDs are stored as strings&#xA;    static let databaseUUIDEncodingStrategy = DatabaseUUIDEncodingStrategy.uppercaseString&#xA;    var id: UUID&#xA;    ...&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;try dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    let uuid = UUID()&#xA;    let player = Player(id: uuid, ...)&#xA;    &#xA;    // OK: inserts a player in the database, with a string uuid&#xA;    try player.insert(db)&#xA;    &#xA;    // OK: performs a string-based query, finds the inserted player&#xA;    _ = try Player.filter(id: uuid).fetchOne(db)&#xA;&#xA;    // NOT OK: performs a blob-based query, fails to find the inserted player&#xA;    _ = try Player.filter(Column(&#34;id&#34;) == uuid).fetchOne(db)&#xA;    &#xA;    // OK: performs a string-based query, finds the inserted player&#xA;    _ = try Player.filter(Column(&#34;id&#34;) == uuid.uuidString).fetchOne(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The userInfo Dictionary&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Your &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#codable-records&#34;&gt;Codable Records&lt;/a&gt; can be stored in the database, but they may also have other purposes. In this case, you may need to customize their implementations of &lt;code&gt;Decodable.init(from:)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Encodable.encode(to:)&lt;/code&gt;, depending on the context.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The standard way to provide such context is the &lt;code&gt;userInfo&lt;/code&gt; dictionary. Implement those properties:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;protocol FetchableRecord {&#xA;    static var databaseDecodingUserInfo: [CodingUserInfoKey: Any] { get }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;protocol EncodableRecord {&#xA;    static var databaseEncodingUserInfo: [CodingUserInfoKey: Any] { get }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, here is a Player type that customizes its decoding:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// A key that holds a decoder&#39;s name&#xA;let decoderName = CodingUserInfoKey(rawValue: &#34;decoderName&#34;)!&#xA;&#xA;struct Player: FetchableRecord, Decodable {&#xA;    init(from decoder: Decoder) throws {&#xA;        // Print the decoder name&#xA;        let decoderName = decoder.userInfo[decoderName] as? String&#xA;        print(&#34;Decoded from \(decoderName ?? &#34;unknown decoder&#34;)&#34;)&#xA;        ...&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can have a specific decoding from JSON...&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// prints &#34;Decoded from JSON&#34;&#xA;let decoder = JSONDecoder()&#xA;decoder.userInfo = [decoderName: &#34;JSON&#34;]&#xA;let player = try decoder.decode(Player.self, from: jsonData)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;... and another one from database rows:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;extension Player: FetchableRecord {&#xA;    static let databaseDecodingUserInfo: [CodingUserInfoKey: Any] = [decoderName: &#34;database row&#34;]&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// prints &#34;Decoded from database row&#34;&#xA;let player = try Player.fetchOne(db, ...)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: make sure the &lt;code&gt;databaseDecodingUserInfo&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;databaseEncodingUserInfo&lt;/code&gt; properties are explicitly declared as &lt;code&gt;[CodingUserInfoKey: Any]&lt;/code&gt;. If they are not, the Swift compiler may silently miss the protocol requirement, resulting in sticky empty userInfo.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Tip: Derive Columns from Coding Keys&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Codable types are granted with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/archives_and_serialization/encoding_and_decoding_custom_types&#34;&gt;CodingKeys&lt;/a&gt; enum. You can use them to safely define database columns:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct Player: Codable {&#xA;    var id: Int64&#xA;    var name: String&#xA;    var score: Int&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;extension Player: FetchableRecord, PersistableRecord {&#xA;    enum Columns {&#xA;        static let id = Column(CodingKeys.id)&#xA;        static let name = Column(CodingKeys.name)&#xA;        static let score = Column(CodingKeys.score)&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#the-query-interface&#34;&gt;query interface&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/GoodPracticesForDesigningRecordTypes.md&#34;&gt;Good Practices for Designing Record Types&lt;/a&gt; for further information.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Record Class&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Record&lt;/strong&gt; is a class that is designed to be subclassed. It inherits its features from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#record-protocols-overview&#34;&gt;FetchableRecord, TableRecord, and PersistableRecord&lt;/a&gt; protocols. On top of that, Record instances can compare against previous versions of themselves in order to &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#record-comparison&#34;&gt;avoid useless updates&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Record subclasses define their custom database relationship by overriding database methods. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;class Place: Record {&#xA;    var id: Int64?&#xA;    var title: String&#xA;    var isFavorite: Bool&#xA;    var coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D&#xA;    &#xA;    init(id: Int64?, title: String, isFavorite: Bool, coordinate: CLLocationCoordinate2D) {&#xA;        self.id = id&#xA;        self.title = title&#xA;        self.isFavorite = isFavorite&#xA;        self.coordinate = coordinate&#xA;        super.init()&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    /// The table name&#xA;    override class var databaseTableName: String { &#34;place&#34; }&#xA;    &#xA;    /// The table columns&#xA;    enum Columns: String, ColumnExpression {&#xA;        case id, title, favorite, latitude, longitude&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    /// Creates a record from a database row&#xA;    required init(row: Row) {&#xA;        id = row[Columns.id]&#xA;        title = row[Columns.title]&#xA;        isFavorite = row[Columns.favorite]&#xA;        coordinate = CLLocationCoordinate2D(&#xA;            latitude: row[Columns.latitude],&#xA;            longitude: row[Columns.longitude])&#xA;        super.init(row: row)&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    /// The values persisted in the database&#xA;    override func encode(to container: inout PersistenceContainer) {&#xA;        container[Columns.id] = id&#xA;        container[Columns.title] = title&#xA;        container[Columns.favorite] = isFavorite&#xA;        container[Columns.latitude] = coordinate.latitude&#xA;        container[Columns.longitude] = coordinate.longitude&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    /// Update record ID after a successful insertion&#xA;    override func didInsert(with rowID: Int64, for column: String?) {&#xA;        id = rowID&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Record Comparison&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Records that adopt the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#persistablerecord-protocol&#34;&gt;EncodableRecord&lt;/a&gt; protocol can compare against other records, or against previous versions of themselves.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This helps avoiding costly UPDATE statements when a record has not been edited.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#the-updatechanges-methods&#34;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;updateChanges&lt;/code&gt; Methods&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#the-databaseequals-method&#34;&gt;The &lt;code&gt;databaseEquals&lt;/code&gt; Method&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;

&#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;updateChanges(_:from:)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This method lets you compare two records:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;if let oldPlayer = try Player.fetchOne(db, id: 42) {&#xA;    var newPlayer = oldPlayer&#xA;    newPlayer.score = 100&#xA;    if try newPlayer.updateChanges(db, from: oldPlayer) {&#xA;        print(&#34;player was modified, and updated in the database&#34;)&#xA;    } else {&#xA;        print(&#34;player was not modified, and database was not hit&#34;)&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;updateChanges(_:with:)&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;This method lets you update a record in place:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;if var player = try Player.fetchOne(db, id: 42) {&#xA;    let modified = try player.updateChanges(db) {&#xA;        $0.score = 100&#xA;    }&#xA;    if modified {&#xA;        print(&#34;player was modified, and updated in the database&#34;)&#xA;    } else {&#xA;        print(&#34;player was not modified, and database was not hit&#34;)&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;updateChanges(_:)&lt;/code&gt; (Record class only)&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instances of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#record-class&#34;&gt;Record&lt;/a&gt; class are able to compare against themselves, and know if they have changes that have not been saved since the last fetch or saving:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Record class only&#xA;if let player = try Player.fetchOne(db, id: 42) {&#xA;    player.score = 100&#xA;    if try player.updateChanges(db) {&#xA;        print(&#34;player was modified, and updated in the database&#34;)&#xA;    } else {&#xA;        print(&#34;player was not modified, and database was not hit&#34;)&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The &lt;code&gt;databaseEquals&lt;/code&gt; Method&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This method returns whether two records have the same database representation:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let oldPlayer: Player = ...&#xA;var newPlayer: Player = ...&#xA;if newPlayer.databaseEquals(oldPlayer) == false {&#xA;    try newPlayer.save(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: The comparison is performed on the database representation of records. As long as your record type adopts the EncodableRecord protocol, you don&#39;t need to care about Equatable.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The &lt;code&gt;databaseChanges&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;hasDatabaseChanges&lt;/code&gt; Methods&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;databaseChanges(from:)&lt;/code&gt; returns a dictionary of differences between two records:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let oldPlayer = Player(id: 1, name: &#34;Arthur&#34;, score: 100)&#xA;let newPlayer = Player(id: 1, name: &#34;Arthur&#34;, score: 1000)&#xA;for (column, oldValue) in newPlayer.databaseChanges(from: oldPlayer) {&#xA;    print(&#34;\(column) was \(oldValue)&#34;)&#xA;}&#xA;// prints &#34;score was 100&#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#record-class&#34;&gt;Record&lt;/a&gt; class is able to compare against itself:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Record class only&#xA;let player = Player(id: 1, name: &#34;Arthur&#34;, score: 100)&#xA;try player.insert(db)&#xA;player.score = 1000&#xA;for (column, oldValue) in player.databaseChanges {&#xA;    print(&#34;\(column) was \(oldValue)&#34;)&#xA;}&#xA;// prints &#34;score was 100&#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#record-class&#34;&gt;Record&lt;/a&gt; instances also have a &lt;code&gt;hasDatabaseChanges&lt;/code&gt; property:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Record class only&#xA;player.score = 1000&#xA;if player.hasDatabaseChanges {&#xA;    try player.save(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Record.hasDatabaseChanges&lt;/code&gt; is false after a Record instance has been fetched or saved into the database. Subsequent modifications may set it, or not: &lt;code&gt;hasDatabaseChanges&lt;/code&gt; is based on value comparison. &lt;strong&gt;Setting a property to the same value does not set the changed flag&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let player = Player(name: &#34;Barbara&#34;, score: 750)&#xA;player.hasDatabaseChanges // true&#xA;&#xA;try player.insert(db)&#xA;player.hasDatabaseChanges // false&#xA;&#xA;player.name = &#34;Barbara&#34;&#xA;player.hasDatabaseChanges // false&#xA;&#xA;player.score = 1000&#xA;player.hasDatabaseChanges // true&#xA;player.databaseChanges    // [&#34;score&#34;: 750]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For an efficient algorithm which synchronizes the content of a database table with a JSON payload, check &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/groue/SortedDifference&#34;&gt;groue/SortedDifference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Record Customization Options&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;GRDB records come with many default behaviors, that are designed to fit most situations.

Yet SQLite let you alter the default behavior, and handle conflicts with specific policies. For example, the &lt;code&gt;INSERT OR REPLACE&lt;/code&gt; statement handles conflicts with the &#34;replace&#34; policy which replaces the conflicting row instead of throwing an error.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/lang_conflict.html&#34;&gt;five different policies&lt;/a&gt; are: abort (the default), replace, rollback, fail, and ignore.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQLite let you specify conflict policies at two different places:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;In the definition of the database table:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// CREATE TABLE player (&#xA;//     id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,&#xA;//     email TEXT UNIQUE ON CONFLICT REPLACE&#xA;// )&#xA;try db.create(table: &#34;player&#34;) { t in&#xA;    t.autoIncrementedPrimaryKey(&#34;id&#34;)&#xA;    t.column(&#34;email&#34;, .text).unique(onConflict: .replace) // &amp;lt;--&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// Despite the unique index on email, both inserts succeed.&#xA;// The second insert replaces the first row:&#xA;try db.execute(sql: &#34;INSERT INTO player (email) VALUES (?)&#34;, arguments: [&#34;arthur@example.com&#34;])&#xA;try db.execute(sql: &#34;INSERT INTO player (email) VALUES (?)&#34;, arguments: [&#34;arthur@example.com&#34;])&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;In each modification query:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// CREATE TABLE player (&#xA;//     id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,&#xA;//     email TEXT UNIQUE&#xA;// )&#xA;try db.create(table: &#34;player&#34;) { t in&#xA;    t.autoIncrementedPrimaryKey(&#34;id&#34;)&#xA;    t.column(&#34;email&#34;, .text).unique()&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// Again, despite the unique index on email, both inserts succeed.&#xA;try db.execute(sql: &#34;INSERT OR REPLACE INTO player (email) VALUES (?)&#34;, arguments: [&#34;arthur@example.com&#34;])&#xA;try db.execute(sql: &#34;INSERT OR REPLACE INTO player (email) VALUES (?)&#34;, arguments: [&#34;arthur@example.com&#34;])&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you want to handle conflicts at the query level, specify a custom &lt;code&gt;persistenceConflictPolicy&lt;/code&gt; in your type that adopts the PersistableRecord protocol. It will alter the INSERT and UPDATE queries run by the &lt;code&gt;insert&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;update&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;save&lt;/code&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#persistence-methods&#34;&gt;persistence methods&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;protocol MutablePersistableRecord {&#xA;    /// The policy that handles SQLite conflicts when records are&#xA;    /// inserted or updated.&#xA;    ///&#xA;    /// This property is optional: its default value uses the ABORT&#xA;    /// policy for both insertions and updates, so that GRDB generate&#xA;    /// regular INSERT and UPDATE queries.&#xA;    static var persistenceConflictPolicy: PersistenceConflictPolicy { get }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;struct Player : MutablePersistableRecord {&#xA;    static let persistenceConflictPolicy = PersistenceConflictPolicy(&#xA;        insert: .replace,&#xA;        update: .replace)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// INSERT OR REPLACE INTO player (...)

Choose your poison:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA; &lt;ul&gt; &#xA;  &lt;li&gt;if you specify the &lt;code&gt;ignore&lt;/code&gt; policy in the database table definition, don&#39;t implement the &lt;code&gt;didInsert&lt;/code&gt; method: it will be called with some random id in case of failed insert.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;  &lt;li&gt;if you specify the &lt;code&gt;ignore&lt;/code&gt; policy at the query level, the &lt;code&gt;didInsert&lt;/code&gt; method is never called.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;/ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;code&gt;replace&lt;/code&gt; policy may have to delete rows so that inserts and updates can succeed. Those deletions are not reported to &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#transactionobserver-protocol&#34;&gt;transaction observers&lt;/a&gt; (this might change in a future release of SQLite).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;The Implicit RowID Primary Key&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;All SQLite tables have a primary key.&lt;/strong&gt; Even when the primary key is not explicit:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// No explicit primary key&#xA;try db.create(table: &#34;event&#34;) { t in&#xA;    t.column(&#34;message&#34;, .text)&#xA;    t.column(&#34;date&#34;, .datetime)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// No way to define an explicit primary key&#xA;try db.create(virtualTable: &#34;book&#34;, using: FTS4()) { t in&#xA;    t.column(&#34;title&#34;)&#xA;    t.column(&#34;author&#34;)&#xA;    t.column(&#34;body&#34;)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The implicit primary key is stored in the hidden column &lt;code&gt;rowid&lt;/code&gt;. Hidden means that &lt;code&gt;SELECT *&lt;/code&gt; does not select it, and yet it can be selected and queried: &lt;code&gt;SELECT *, rowid ... WHERE rowid = 1&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some GRDB methods will automatically use this hidden column when a table has no explicit primary key:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// SELECT * FROM event WHERE rowid = 1&#xA;let event = try Event.fetchOne(db, id: 1)&#xA;&#xA;// DELETE FROM book WHERE rowid = 1&#xA;try Book.deleteOne(db, id: 1)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Exposing the RowID Column&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;By default, a record type that wraps a table without any explicit primary key doesn&#39;t know about the hidden rowid column.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Without primary key, records don&#39;t have any identity, and the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#persistence-methods&#34;&gt;persistence method&lt;/a&gt; can behave in undesired fashion: &lt;code&gt;update()&lt;/code&gt; throws errors, &lt;code&gt;save()&lt;/code&gt; always performs insertions and may break constraints, &lt;code&gt;exists()&lt;/code&gt; is always false.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When SQLite won&#39;t let you provide an explicit primary key (as in &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/FullTextSearch.md&#34;&gt;full-text&lt;/a&gt; tables, for example), you may want to make your record type fully aware of the hidden rowid column:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have the &lt;code&gt;databaseSelection&lt;/code&gt; static property (from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#tablerecord-protocol&#34;&gt;TableRecord&lt;/a&gt; protocol) return the hidden rowid column:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct Event : TableRecord {&#xA;    static let databaseSelection: [SQLSelectable] = [AllColumns(), Column.rowID]&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// When you subclass Record, you need an override:&#xA;class Book : Record {&#xA;    override class var databaseSelection: [SQLSelectable] {&#xA;        [AllColums(), Column.rowID]&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;GRDB will then select the &lt;code&gt;rowid&lt;/code&gt; column by default:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// SELECT *, rowid FROM event&#xA;let events = try Event.fetchAll(db)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Have &lt;code&gt;init(row:)&lt;/code&gt; from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#fetchablerecord-protocol&#34;&gt;FetchableRecord&lt;/a&gt; protocol consume the &#34;rowid&#34; column:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct Event : FetchableRecord {&#xA;    var id: Int64?&#xA;    &#xA;    init(row: Row) {&#xA;        id = row[Column.rowID] // or `row[.rowID]` with Swift 5.5+&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your fetched records will then know their ids:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let event = try Event.fetchOne(db)!&#xA;event.id // some value&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Encode the rowid in &lt;code&gt;encode(to:)&lt;/code&gt;, and keep it in the &lt;code&gt;didInsert(with:for:)&lt;/code&gt; method (both from the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#persistablerecord-protocol&#34;&gt;PersistableRecord and MutablePersistableRecord&lt;/a&gt; protocols):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct Event : MutablePersistableRecord {&#xA;    var id: Int64?&#xA;    &#xA;    func encode(to container: inout PersistenceContainer) {&#xA;        container[Column.rowID] = id // or `container[.rowID]` with Swift 5.5+&#xA;        container[&#34;message&#34;] = message&#xA;        container[&#34;date&#34;] = date&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    // Update auto-incremented id upon successful insertion&#xA;    mutating func didInsert(with rowID: Int64, for column: String?) {&#xA;        id = rowID&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;You will then be able to track your record ids, update them, or check for their existence:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let event = Event(message: &#34;foo&#34;, date: Date())&#xA;&#xA;// Insertion sets the record id:&#xA;try event.insert(db)&#xA;event.id // some value&#xA;&#xA;// Record can be updated:&#xA;event.message = &#34;bar&#34;&#xA;try event.update(db)&#xA;&#xA;// Record knows if it exists:&#xA;event.exists(db) // true&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Beyond FetchableRecord&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Some GRDB users eventually discover that the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#fetchablerecord-protocol&#34;&gt;FetchableRecord&lt;/a&gt; protocol does not fit all situations.&lt;/strong&gt; Use cases that are not well handled by FetchableRecord include:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your application needs polymorphic row decoding: it decodes some type or another, depending on the values contained in a database row.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your application needs to decode rows with a context: each decoded value should be initialized with some extra value that does not come from the database.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Your application needs a record type that supports untrusted databases, and may fail at decoding database rows (throw an error when a row contains invalid values).&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since those use cases are not well handled by FetchableRecord, don&#39;t try to implement them on top of this protocol: you&#39;ll just fight the framework.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, please have a look at the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/Playgrounds/CustomizedDecodingOfDatabaseRows.playground/Contents.swift&#34;&gt;CustomizedDecodingOfDatabaseRows&lt;/a&gt; playground. You&#39;ll run some sample code, and learn how to escape FetchableRecord when you need. And remember that leaving FetchableRecord will not deprive you of &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#requests&#34;&gt;query interface requests&lt;/a&gt; and generally all SQL generation features of the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#tablerecord-protocol&#34;&gt;TableRecord&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#persistablerecord-protocol&#34;&gt;PersistableRecord&lt;/a&gt; protocols.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Examples of Record Definitions&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We will show below how to declare a record type for the following database table:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    try db.create(table: &#34;place&#34;) { t in&#xA;        t.autoIncrementedPrimaryKey(&#34;id&#34;)&#xA;        t.column(&#34;title&#34;, .text).notNull()&#xA;        t.column(&#34;isFavorite&#34;, .boolean).notNull().defaults(to: false)&#xA;        t.column(&#34;longitude&#34;, .double).notNull()&#xA;        t.column(&#34;latitude&#34;, .double).notNull()&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Each one of the three examples below is correct. You will pick one or the other depending on your personal preferences and the requirements of your application:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;details&gt; &#xA; &lt;summary&gt;Define a Codable struct, and adopt the record protocols you need&lt;/summary&gt;

&#xA;&lt;h1&gt;The Query Interface&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The query interface lets you write pure Swift instead of SQL:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    // Update database schema&#xA;    try db.create(table: &#34;wine&#34;) { t in ... }&#xA;    &#xA;    // Fetch records&#xA;    let wines = try Wine&#xA;        .filter(originColumn == &#34;Burgundy&#34;)&#xA;

       .deleteAll(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You need to open a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-connections&#34;&gt;database connection&lt;/a&gt; before you can query the database.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Please bear in mind that the query interface can not generate all possible SQL queries. You may also &lt;em&gt;prefer&lt;/em&gt; writing SQL, and this is just OK. From little snippets to full queries, your SQL skills are welcome:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    // Update database schema (with SQL)&#xA;    try db.execute(sql: &#34;CREATE TABLE wine (...)&#34;)&#xA;    &#xA;    // Fetch records (with SQL)&#xA;    let wines = try Wine.fetchAll(db,&#xA;        sql: &#34;SELECT * FROM wine WHERE origin = ?

       .fetchCount(db)&#xA;    &#xA;    // Update (with SQL)&#xA;    try db.execute(sql: &#34;UPDATE wine SET price = price * 0.75 WHERE origin = &#39;Burgundy&#39;&#34;)&#xA;    &#xA;    // Delete (with SQL)&#xA;    try db.execute(sql: &#34;DELETE FROM wine WHERE corked&#34;)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;So don&#39;t miss the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#sqlite-api&#34;&gt;SQL API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Create Tables&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// CREATE TABLE place (&#xA;//   id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,&#xA;//   title TEXT,&#xA;//   favorite BOOLEAN NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,&#xA;//   latitude DOUBLE NOT NULL,&#xA;//   longitude DOUBLE NOT NULL&#xA;// )&#xA;try db.create(table: &#34;place&#34;) { t in&#xA;    t.autoIncrementedPrimaryKey(&#34;id&#34;)&#xA;    t.column(&#34;title&#34;, .text)&#xA;    t.column(&#34;favorite&#34;, .boolean).notNull().defaults(to: false)&#xA;    t.column(&#34;longitude&#34;, .double).notNull()&#xA;    t.column(&#34;latitude&#34;, .double).notNull()&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;create(table:)&lt;/code&gt; method covers nearly all SQLite table creation features. For virtual tables, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/FullTextSearch.md&#34;&gt;Full-Text Search&lt;/a&gt;, or use raw SQL.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;SQLite itself has many reference documents about table creation: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtable.html&#34;&gt;CREATE TABLE&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html&#34;&gt;Datatypes In SQLite Version 3&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html&#34;&gt;SQLite Foreign Key Support&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/lang_conflict.html&#34;&gt;ON CONFLICT&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/withoutrowid.html&#34;&gt;The WITHOUT ROWID Optimization&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Configure table creation&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// CREATE TABLE example ( ... )&#xA;try db.create(table: &#34;example&#34;) { t in ... }&#xA;    &#xA;// CREATE TEMPORARY TABLE example IF NOT EXISTS (&#xA;try db.create(table: &#34;example&#34;, options: [.temporary, .ifNotExists]) { t in ... }&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: database table names should be singular, and camelCased. Make them look like Swift identifiers: &lt;code&gt;place&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;country&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;postalAddress&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;httpRequest&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;This will help you using &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/AssociationsBasics.md&#34;&gt;Associations&lt;/a&gt; when you need them. Database table names that follow another naming convention are totally OK, but you will need to perform extra configuration.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/withoutrowid.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;WITHOUT ROWID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tables can not be tracked with &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-changes-observation&#34;&gt;Database Observation&lt;/a&gt; tools.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Add regular columns&lt;/strong&gt; with their name and eventual type (&lt;code&gt;text&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;integer&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;double&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;real&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;numeric&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;boolean&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;blob&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;datetime&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;any&lt;/code&gt;) - see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html&#34;&gt;SQLite data types&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// CREATE TABLE example (&#xA;//   a,&#xA;//   name TEXT,&#xA;//   creationDate DATETIME,&#xA;try db.create(table: &#34;example&#34;) { t in&#xA;    t.column(&#34;a&#34;)&#xA;    t.column(&#34;name&#34;, .text)&#xA;    t.column(&#34;creationDate&#34;, .datetime)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Define &lt;strong&gt;not null&lt;/strong&gt; columns, and set &lt;strong&gt;default&lt;/strong&gt; values:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;    // email TEXT NOT NULL,&#xA;    t.column(&#34;email&#34;, .text).notNull()&#xA;    &#xA;    // name TEXT NOT NULL DEFAULT &#39;Anonymous&#39;,&#xA;    t.column(&#34;name&#34;, .text).notNull().defaults(to: &#34;Anonymous&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Use an individual column as &lt;strong&gt;primary&lt;/strong&gt;, &lt;strong&gt;unique&lt;/strong&gt;, or &lt;strong&gt;foreign key&lt;/strong&gt;. When defining a foreign key, the referenced column is the primary key of the referenced table (unless you specify otherwise):&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;    // id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT,&#xA;    t.autoIncrementedPrimaryKey(&#34;id&#34;)&#xA;    &#xA;    // uuid TEXT PRIMARY KEY,&#xA;    t.column(&#34;uuid&#34;, .text).primaryKey()&#xA;    &#xA;    // email TEXT UNIQUE,&#xA;    t.column(&#34;email&#34;, .text).unique()&#xA;    &#xA;    // countryCode TEXT REFERENCES country(code) ON DELETE CASCADE,&#xA;    t.column(&#34;countryCode&#34;, .text).references(&#34;country&#34;, onDelete: .cascade)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: when you need an integer primary key that automatically generates unique values, it is highly recommended that you use the &lt;code&gt;autoIncrementedPrimaryKey&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try db.create(table: &#34;example&#34;) { t in&#xA;    t.autoIncrementedPrimaryKey(&#34;id&#34;)&#xA;    ...&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;The reason for this recommendation is that auto-incremented primary keys prevent the reuse of ids. This prevents your app or &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-changes-observation&#34;&gt;database observation tools&lt;/a&gt; to think that a row was updated, when it was actually deleted, then replaced. Depending on your application needs, this may be acceptable. But usually it is not.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Create an index&lt;/strong&gt; on the column:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;    t.column(&#34;score&#34;, .integer).indexed()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For extra index options, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#create-indexes&#34;&gt;Create Indexes&lt;/a&gt; below.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Perform integrity checks&lt;/strong&gt; on individual columns, and SQLite will only let conforming rows in. In the example below, the &lt;code&gt;$0&lt;/code&gt; closure variable is a column which lets you build any SQL &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#expressions&#34;&gt;expression&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;    // name TEXT CHECK (LENGTH(name) &amp;gt; 0)&#xA;    // score INTEGER CHECK (score &amp;gt; 0)&#xA;    t.column(&#34;name&#34;, .text).check { length($0) &amp;gt; 0 }&#xA;    t.column(&#34;score&#34;, .integer).check(sql: &#34;score &amp;gt; 0&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Columns can also be defined with a raw sql String, or an &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/SQLInterpolation.md#sql-literal&#34;&gt;SQL literal&lt;/a&gt; in which you can safely embed raw values without any risk of syntax errors or SQL injection:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;    t.column(sql: &#34;name TEXT&#34;)&#xA;    &#xA;    let defaultName: String = ...&#xA;    t.column(literal: &#34;name TEXT DEFAULT \(defaultName)&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Other &lt;strong&gt;table constraints&lt;/strong&gt; can involve several columns:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;    // PRIMARY KEY (a, b),&#xA;    t.primaryKey([&#34;a&#34;, &#34;b&#34;])&#xA;    &#xA;    // UNIQUE (a, b) ON CONFLICT REPLACE,&#xA;    t.uniqueKey([&#34;a&#34;, &#34;b&#34;], onConflict: .replace)&#xA;    &#xA;    // FOREIGN KEY (a, b) REFERENCES parents(c, d),&#xA;    t.foreignKey([&#34;a&#34;, &#34;b&#34;], references: &#34;parents&#34;)&#xA;    &#xA;    // CHECK (a + b &amp;lt; 10),&#xA;    t.check(Column(&#34;a&#34;) + Column(&#34;b&#34;) &amp;lt; 10)&#xA;    &#xA;    // CHECK (a + b &amp;lt; 10)&#xA;    t.check(sql: &#34;a + b &amp;lt; 10&#34;)&#xA;    &#xA;    // Raw SQL constraints&#xA;    t.constraint(sql: &#34;CHECK (a + b &amp;lt; 10)&#34;)&#xA;    t.constraint(literal: &#34;CHECK (a + b &amp;lt; \(10))&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://sqlite.org/gencol.html&#34;&gt;Generated columns&lt;/a&gt; are available with a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/CustomSQLiteBuilds.md&#34;&gt;custom SQLite build&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;    t.column(&#34;totalScore&#34;, .integer).generatedAs(sql: &#34;score + bonus&#34;)&#xA;    t.column(&#34;totalScore&#34;, .integer).generatedAs(Column(&#34;score&#34;) + Column(&#34;bonus&#34;))&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Modify Tables&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;SQLite lets you modify existing tables:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// ALTER TABLE referer RENAME TO referrer&#xA;try db.rename(table: &#34;referer&#34;, to: &#34;referrer&#34;)&#xA;&#xA;// ALTER TABLE player ADD COLUMN hasBonus BOOLEAN&#xA;// ALTER TABLE player RENAME COLUMN url TO homeURL&#xA;// ALTER TABLE player DROP COLUMN score&#xA;try db.alter(table: &#34;player&#34;) { t in&#xA;    t.add(column: &#34;hasBonus&#34;, .boolean)&#xA;    t.rename(column: &#34;url&#34;, to: &#34;homeURL&#34;) // SQLite 3.25+&#xA;    t.drop(column: &#34;score&#34;) // SQLite 3.35+&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: SQLite restricts the possible table alterations, and may require you to recreate dependent triggers or views.

Nothing against them, but they are not unicode aware.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Instead, GRDB extends SQLite with SQL functions that call the Swift built-in string functions &lt;code&gt;capitalized&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lowercased&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;uppercased&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;localizedCapitalized&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;localizedLowercased&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;localizedUppercased&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;Player.select(nameColumn.uppercased())&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: When &lt;em&gt;comparing&lt;/em&gt; strings, you&#39;d rather use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#string-comparison&#34;&gt;collation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;   &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let name: String = ...&#xA;&#xA;// Not recommended&#xA;nameColumn.uppercased() == name.uppercased()&#xA;&#xA;// Better&#xA;nameColumn.collating(.caseInsensitiveCompare) == name&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Custom SQL functions and aggregates&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;You can apply your own &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#custom-functions-&#34;&gt;custom SQL functions and aggregates&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let f = DatabaseFunction(&#34;f&#34;, ...)&#xA;&#xA;// SELECT f(name) FROM player&#xA;Player.select(f.apply(nameColumn))&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Embedding SQL in Query Interface Requests&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You will sometimes want to extend your query interface requests with SQL snippets. This can happen because GRDB does not provide a Swift interface for some SQL function or operator, or because you want to use an SQLite construct that GRDB does not support.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Support for extensibility is large, but not unlimited. All the SQL queries built by the query interface request have the shape below. &lt;em&gt;If you need something else, you&#39;ll have to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#sqlite-api&#34;&gt;raw SQL requests&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;WITH ...     -- 1&#xA;SELECT ...   -- 2&#xA;FROM ...     -- 3&#xA;JOIN ...     -- 4&#xA;WHERE ...    -- 5&#xA;GROUP BY ... -- 6&#xA;HAVING ...   -- 7&#xA;ORDER BY ... -- 8&#xA;LIMIT ...    -- 9&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;WITH ...&lt;/code&gt;: see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/CommonTableExpressions.md&#34;&gt;Common Table Expressions&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT ...&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The selection can be provided as raw SQL:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// SELECT IFNULL(name, &#39;O&#39;&#39;Brien&#39;), score FROM player&#xA;let request = Player.select(sql: &#34;IFNULL(name, &#39;O&#39;&#39;Brien&#39;), score&#34;)&#xA;&#xA;// SELECT IFNULL(name, &#39;O&#39;&#39;Brien&#39;), score FROM player&#xA;let defaultName = &#34;O&#39;Brien&#34;&#xA;let request = Player.select(sql: &#34;IFNULL(name, ?), score&#34;, arguments: [suffix])&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;The selection can be provided with &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/SQLInterpolation.md&#34;&gt;SQL Interpolation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// SELECT IFNULL(name, &#39;O&#39;&#39;Brien&#39;), score FROM player&#xA;let defaultName = &#34;O&#39;Brien&#34;&#xA;let request = Player.select(literal: &#34;IFNULL(name, \(defaultName)), score&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;The selection can be provided with a mix of Swift and &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/SQLInterpolation.md&#34;&gt;SQL Interpolation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// SELECT IFNULL(name, &#39;O&#39;&#39;Brien&#39;) AS displayName, score FROM player&#xA;let defaultName = &#34;O&#39;Brien&#34;&#xA;let displayName: SQL = &#34;IFNULL(\(Column(&#34;name&#34;)), \(defaultName)) AS displayName&#34;&#xA;let request = Player.select(displayName, Column(&#34;score&#34;))&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;When the custom SQL snippet should behave as a full-fledged expression, with support for the &lt;code&gt;+&lt;/code&gt; Swift operator, the &lt;code&gt;forKey&lt;/code&gt; aliasing method, and all other &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#sql-operators&#34;&gt;SQL Operators&lt;/a&gt;, build an &lt;em&gt;expression literal&lt;/em&gt; with the &lt;code&gt;SQL.sqlExpression&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// SELECT IFNULL(name, &#39;O&#39;&#39;Brien&#39;) AS displayName, score FROM player&#xA;let defaultName = &#34;O&#39;Brien&#34;&#xA;let displayName = SQL(&#34;IFNULL(\(Column(&#34;name&#34;)), \(defaultName))&#34;).sqlExpression&#xA;let request = Player.select(displayName.forKey(&#34;displayName&#34;), Column(&#34;score&#34;))&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Such expression literals allow you to build a reusable support library of SQL functions or operators that are missing from the query interface. For example, you can define a Swift &lt;code&gt;date&lt;/code&gt; function:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;func date(_ value: SQLSpecificExpressible) -&amp;gt; SQLExpression {&#xA;    SQL(&#34;DATE(\(value))&#34;).sqlExpression&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// SELECT * FROM &#34;player&#34; WHERE DATE(&#34;createdAt&#34;) = &#39;2020-01-23&#39;&#xA;let request = Player.filter(date(Column(&#34;createdAt&#34;)) == &#34;2020-01-23&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/QueryInterfaceOrganization.md&#34;&gt;Query Interface Organization&lt;/a&gt; for more information about &lt;code&gt;SQLSpecificExpressible&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SQLExpression&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;FROM ...&lt;/code&gt;: only one table is supported here. You can not customize this SQL part.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;JOIN ...&lt;/code&gt;: joins are fully controlled by &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/AssociationsBasics.md&#34;&gt;Associations&lt;/a&gt;.

You can not customize this SQL part.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Fetching from Requests&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Once you have a request, you can fetch the records at the origin of the request:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Some request based on `Player`&#xA;let request = Player.filter(...)... // QueryInterfaceRequest&amp;lt;Player&amp;gt;&#xA;&#xA;// Fetch players:&#xA;try request.fetchCursor(db) // A Cursor of Player&#xA;try request.fetchAll(db)    // [Player]&#xA;try request.fetchSet(db)    // Set&amp;lt;Player&amp;gt;&#xA;try request.fetchOne(db)    // Player?&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let allPlayers = try Player.fetchAll(db)                            // [Player]&#xA;let arthur = try Player.filter(nameColumn == &#34;Arthur&#34;).fetchOne(db) // Player?&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#fetching-methods&#34;&gt;fetching methods&lt;/a&gt; for information about the &lt;code&gt;fetchCursor&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fetchAll&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fetchSet&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;fetchOne&lt;/code&gt; methods.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You sometimes want to fetch other values&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The simplest way is to use the request as an argument to a fetching method of the desired type:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Fetch an Int&#xA;let request = Player.select(max(scoreColumn))&#xA;let maxScore = try Int.fetchOne(db, request) // Int?&#xA;&#xA;// Fetch a Row&#xA;let request = Player.select(min(scoreColumn), max(scoreColumn))&#xA;let row = try Row.fetchOne(db, request)!     // Row&#xA;let minScore = row[0] as Int?&#xA;let maxScore = row[1] as Int?&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also change the request so that it knows the type it has to fetch:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;asRequest(of:)&lt;/code&gt;, useful when you use &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/AssociationsBasics.md&#34;&gt;Associations&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct BookInfo: FetchableRecord, Decodable {&#xA;    var book: Book&#xA;    var author: Author&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// A request of BookInfo&#xA;let request = Book&#xA;    .including(required: Book.author)&#xA;    .asRequest(of: BookInfo.self)&#xA;&#xA;let bookInfos = try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    try request.fetchAll(db) // [BookInfo]&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;With &lt;code&gt;select(..., as:)&lt;/code&gt;, which is handy when you change the selection:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// A request of Int&#xA;let request = Player.select(max(scoreColumn), as: Int.self)&#xA;&#xA;let maxScore = try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;

is a common task.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#identifiable-records&#34;&gt;Identifiable Records&lt;/a&gt; can use the type-safe methods &lt;code&gt;fetchOne(_&lt;span&gt;🆔&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;fetchAll(_:ids:)&lt;/code&gt;

&#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try Player.fetchOne(db, key: 1)              // Player?&#xA;try Country.fetchAll(db, keys: [&#34;FR&#34;, &#34;US&#34;]) // [Country]&#xA;try Player.fetchOne(db, key: [&#34;email&#34;: &#34;arthur@example.com&#34;])            // Player?&#xA;try Citizenship.fetchOne(db, key: [&#34;citizenId&#34;: 1, &#34;countryCode&#34;: &#34;FR&#34;]) // Citizenship?&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the table has no explicit primary key, GRDB uses the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#the-implicit-rowid-primary-key&#34;&gt;hidden &#34;rowid&#34; column&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// SELECT * FROM document WHERE rowid = 1&#xA;try Document.fetchOne(db, key: 1)            // Document?&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When you want to build a request and plan to fetch from it later&lt;/strong&gt;, use a &lt;code&gt;filter&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let request = Player.filter(id: 1)&#xA;let request = Country.filter(ids: [&#34;FR&#34;, &#34;US&#34;])&#xA;let request = Player.filter(key: [&#34;email&#34;: &#34;arthur@example.com&#34;])&#xA;let request = Citizenship.filter(key: [&#34;citizenId&#34;: 1, &#34;countryCode&#34;: &#34;FR&#34;])&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Testing for Record Existence&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can check if a request has matching rows in the database.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Some request based on `Player`&#xA;let request = Player.filter(...)...&#xA;&#xA;// Check for player existence:&#xA;let noSuchPlayer = try request.isEmpty(db) // Bool&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can also check if a given primary or unique key exists in the database.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#identifiable-records&#34;&gt;Identifiable Records&lt;/a&gt; can use the type-safe method &lt;code&gt;exists(_&lt;span&gt;🆔&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try Player.exists(db, id: 1)&#xA;try Country.exists(db, id: &#34;FR&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;All record types can use &lt;code&gt;exists(_&lt;span&gt;🔑&lt;/span&gt;)&lt;/code&gt; that can check primary and unique keys:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try Player.exists(db, key: 1)&#xA;try Country.exists(db, key: &#34;FR&#34;)&#xA;try Player.exists(db, key: [&#34;email&#34;: &#34;arthur@example.com&#34;])&#xA;try Citizenship.exists(db, key: [&#34;citizenId&#34;: 1, &#34;countryCode&#34;: &#34;FR&#34;])&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;

&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Fetching Aggregated Values&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requests can count.&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;code&gt;fetchCount()&lt;/code&gt; method returns the number of rows that would be returned by a fetch request:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// SELECT COUNT(*) FROM player&#xA;let count = try Player.fetchCount(db) // Int&#xA;&#xA;// SELECT COUNT(*) FROM player WHERE email IS NOT NULL&#xA;let count = try Player.filter(emailColumn != nil).fetchCount(db)&#xA;&#xA;// SELECT COUNT(DISTINCT name) FROM player&#xA;let count = try Player.select(nameColumn).distinct().fetchCount(db)&#xA;&#xA;// SELECT COUNT(*) FROM (SELECT DISTINCT name, score FROM player)&#xA;let count = try Player.select(nameColumn, scoreColumn).distinct().fetchCount(db)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Other aggregated values&lt;/strong&gt; can also be selected and fetched (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#sql-functions&#34;&gt;SQL Functions&lt;/a&gt;):&lt;/p&gt;

&#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Delete Requests&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Requests can delete records&lt;/strong&gt;, with the &lt;code&gt;deleteAll()&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// DELETE FROM player&#xA;try Player.deleteAll(db)&#xA;&#xA;// DELETE FROM player WHERE team = &#39;red&#39;&#xA;try Player&#xA;

The &lt;code&gt;updateAll()&lt;/code&gt; method accepts &lt;em&gt;column assignments&lt;/em&gt; defined with the &lt;code&gt;set(to:)&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// UPDATE player SET score = 0, isHealthy = 1, bonus = NULL&#xA;try Player.updateAll(db, &#xA;    Column(&#34;score&#34;).set(to: 0), &#xA;    Column(&#34;isHealthy&#34;).set(to: true), &#xA;    Column(&#34;bonus&#34;).set(to: nil))&#xA;&#xA;// UPDATE player SET score = 0 WHERE team = &#39;red&#39;&#xA;try Player&#xA;    .filter(Column(&#34;team&#34;) == &#34;red&#34;)&#xA;    .updateAll(db, Column(&#34;score&#34;).set(to: 0))&#xA;&#xA;// UPDATE player SET top = 1 ORDER BY score DESC LIMIT 10&#xA;try Player&#xA;    .order(Column(&#34;score&#34;).desc)&#xA;    .limit(10)&#xA;    .updateAll(db, Column(&#34;top&#34;).set(to: true))&#xA;&#xA;// UPDATE country SET population = 67848156 WHERE id = &#39;FR&#39;&#xA;try Country&#xA;    .filter(id: &#34;FR&#34;)&#xA;    .updateAll(db, Column(&#34;population&#34;).set(to: 67_848_156))&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Column assignments accept any expression:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// UPDATE player SET score = score + (bonus * 2)&#xA;try Player.updateAll(db, Column(&#34;score&#34;).set(to: Column(&#34;score&#34;) + Column(&#34;bonus&#34;) * 2))&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;As a convenience, you can also use the &lt;code&gt;+=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;-=&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;*=&lt;/code&gt;, or &lt;code&gt;/=&lt;/code&gt; operators:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// UPDATE player SET score = score + (bonus * 2)&#xA;try Player.updateAll(db, Column(&#34;score&#34;) += Column(&#34;bonus&#34;) * 2)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Default &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#conflict-resolution&#34;&gt;Conflict Resolution&lt;/a&gt; rules apply, and you may also provide a specific one:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// UPDATE OR IGNORE player SET ...&#xA;try Player.updateAll(db, onConflict: .ignore, /* assignments... */)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt; The &lt;code&gt;updateAll&lt;/code&gt; method is available on types that adopt the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#tablerecord-protocol&#34;&gt;TableRecord&lt;/a&gt; protocol, and &lt;code&gt;Table&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct Player: TableRecord { ... }&#xA;try Player.updateAll(db, ...)          // Fine&#xA;try Table(&#34;player&#34;).updateAll(db, ...) // Just as fine&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Custom Requests&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Until now, we have seen &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#requests&#34;&gt;requests&lt;/a&gt; created from any type that adopts the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#tablerecord-protocol&#34;&gt;TableRecord&lt;/a&gt; protocol:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let request = Player.all()  // QueryInterfaceRequest&amp;lt;Player&amp;gt;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those requests of type &lt;code&gt;QueryInterfaceRequest&lt;/code&gt; can fetch and count:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try request.fetchCursor(db) // A Cursor of Player&#xA;try request.fetchAll(db)    // [Player]&#xA;try request.fetchSet(db)    // Set&amp;lt;Player&amp;gt;&#xA;try request.fetchOne(db)    // Player?&#xA;try request.fetchCount(db)  // Int&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;When the query interface can not generate the SQL you need&lt;/strong&gt;, you can still fallback to &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#fetch-queries&#34;&gt;raw SQL&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Custom SQL is always welcome&#xA;try Player.fetchAll(db, sql: &#34;SELECT ...&#34;)   // [Player]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;But you may prefer to bring some elegance back in, and build custom requests:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// No custom SQL in sight&#xA;try Player.customRequest().fetchAll(db) // [Player]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;To build custom requests&lt;/strong&gt;, you can use one of the built-in requests or derive requests from other requests.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://groue.github.io/GRDB.swift/docs/5.24/Structs/SQLRequest.html&#34;&gt;SQLRequest&lt;/a&gt; is a fetch request built from raw SQL. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;extension Player {&#xA;    static func filter(color: Color) -&amp;gt; SQLRequest&amp;lt;Player&amp;gt; {&#xA;        SQLRequest&amp;lt;Player&amp;gt;(&#xA;            sql: &#34;SELECT * FROM player WHERE color = ?&#34;&#xA;            arguments: [color])&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// [Player]&#xA;try Player.filter(color: .red).fetchAll(db)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;SQLRequest supports &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/SQLInterpolation.md&#34;&gt;SQL Interpolation&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;extension Player {&#xA;    static func filter(color: Color) -&amp;gt; SQLRequest&amp;lt;Player&amp;gt; {&#xA;        &#34;SELECT * FROM player WHERE color = \(color)&#34;&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;asRequest(of:)&lt;/code&gt; method changes the type fetched by the request. It is useful, for example, when you use &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/AssociationsBasics.md&#34;&gt;Associations&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct BookInfo: FetchableRecord, Decodable {&#xA;    var book: Book&#xA;    var author: Author&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;let request = Book&#xA;    .including(required: Book.author)&#xA;    .asRequest(of: BookInfo.self)&#xA;&#xA;// [BookInfo]&#xA;try request.fetchAll(db)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;adapted(_:)&lt;/code&gt; method eases the consumption of complex rows with &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#row-adapters&#34;&gt;row adapters&lt;/a&gt;. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#joined-queries-support&#34;&gt;Joined Queries Support&lt;/a&gt; for some sample code that uses this method.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;http://groue.github.io/GRDB.swift/docs/5.24/Structs/AnyFetchRequest.html&#34;&gt;AnyFetchRequest&lt;/a&gt;: a type-erased request.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Joined Queries Support&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRDB helps consuming joined queries with complex selection.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In this chapter, we will focus on the extraction of information from complex rows, such as the ones fetched by the query below:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;-- How to consume the left, middle, and right parts of those rows?&#xA;SELECT player.*, team.*, MAX(round.score) AS maxScore&#xA;FROM player&#xA;LEFT JOIN team ON ...&#xA;LEFT JOIN round ON ...&#xA;GROUP BY ...&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We will not talk about the &lt;em&gt;generation&lt;/em&gt; of joined queries, which is covered in &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/AssociationsBasics.md&#34;&gt;Associations&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So what are we talking about?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is difficult to consume rows fetched from complex joined queries, because they often contain several columns with the same name: &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; from table &lt;code&gt;player&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; from table &lt;code&gt;team&lt;/code&gt;, etc.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When such ambiguity happens, GRDB row accessors always favor the leftmost matching column. This means that &lt;code&gt;row[&#34;id&#34;]&lt;/code&gt; would give a player id, without any obvious way to access the team id.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;A classical technique to avoid this ambiguity is to give each column a unique name. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;-- A classical technique&#xA;SELECT player.id AS player_id, player.name AS player_name, team.id AS team_id, team.name AS team_name, team.color AS team_color, MAX(round.score) AS maxScore&#xA;FROM player&#xA;LEFT JOIN team ON ...&#xA;LEFT JOIN round ON ...&#xA;GROUP BY ...&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This technique works pretty well, but it has three drawbacks:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;The selection becomes hard to read and understand.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Such queries are difficult to write by hand.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;The mangled names are a &lt;em&gt;very&lt;/em&gt; bad fit for &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#fetchablerecord-protocol&#34;&gt;FetchableRecord&lt;/a&gt; types that expect specific column names. After all, if the &lt;code&gt;Team&lt;/code&gt; record type can read &lt;code&gt;SELECT * FROM team ...&lt;/code&gt;, it should be able to read &lt;code&gt;SELECT ..., team.*, ...&lt;/code&gt; as well.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We thus need another technique. &lt;strong&gt;Below we&#39;ll see how to split rows into slices, and preserve column names.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;SELECT player.*, team.*, MAX(round.score) AS maxScore FROM ...&lt;/code&gt; will be split into three slices: one that contains player&#39;s columns, one that contains team&#39;s columns, and a remaining slice that contains remaining column(s). The Player record type will be able to read the first slice, which contains the columns expected by the &lt;code&gt;Player.init(row:)&lt;/code&gt; initializer. In the same way, the Team record type could read the second slice.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Unlike the name-mangling technique, splitting rows keeps SQL legible, accepts your hand-crafted SQL queries, and plays as nicely as possible with your existing &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#records&#34;&gt;record types&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#splitting-rows-an-introduction&#34;&gt;Splitting Rows, an Introduction&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#splitting-rows-the-record-way&#34;&gt;Splitting Rows, the Record Way&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#splitting-rows-the-codable-way&#34;&gt;Splitting Rows, the Codable Way&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Splitting Rows, an Introduction&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s first write some introductory code, hoping that this chapter will make you understand how pieces fall together. We&#39;ll see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#splitting-rows-the-record-way&#34;&gt;later&lt;/a&gt; how records will help us streamline the initial approach, how to track changes in joined requests, and how we can use the standard Decodable protocol.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To split rows, we will use &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#row-adapters&#34;&gt;row adapters&lt;/a&gt;. Row adapters adapt rows so that row consumers see exactly the columns they want. Among other things, row adapters can define several &lt;em&gt;row scopes&lt;/em&gt; that give access to as many &lt;em&gt;row slices&lt;/em&gt;. Sounds like a perfect match.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;At the very beginning, there is an SQL query:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    let sql = &#34;&#34;&#34;&#xA;        SELECT player.*, team.*, MAX(round.score) AS maxScore&#xA;        FROM player&#xA;        LEFT JOIN team ON ...&#xA;        LEFT JOIN round ON ...&#xA;        GROUP BY ...&#xA;        &#34;&#34;&#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We need an adapter that extracts player columns, in a slice that has as many columns as there are columns in the player table. That&#39;s &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#rangerowadapter&#34;&gt;RangeRowAdapter&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;    // SELECT player.*, team.*, ...&#xA;    //        &amp;lt;------&amp;gt;&#xA;    let playerWidth = try db.columns(in: &#34;player&#34;).count&#xA;    let playerAdapter = RangeRowAdapter(0 ..&amp;lt; playerWidth)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We also need an adapter that extracts team columns:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;    // SELECT player.*, team.*, ...&#xA;    //                  &amp;lt;----&amp;gt;&#xA;    let teamWidth = try db.columns(in: &#34;team&#34;).count&#xA;    let teamAdapter = RangeRowAdapter(playerWidth ..&amp;lt; (playerWidth + teamWidth))&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We merge those two adapters in a single &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#scopeadapter&#34;&gt;ScopeAdapter&lt;/a&gt; that will allow us to access both sliced rows:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;    let playerScope = &#34;player&#34;&#xA;    let teamScope = &#34;team&#34;&#xA;    let adapter = ScopeAdapter([&#xA;        playerScope: playerAdapter,&#xA;        teamScope: teamAdapter])&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;And now we can fetch, and start consuming our rows. You already know &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#fetching-rows&#34;&gt;row cursors&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;    let rows = try Row.fetchCursor(db, sql: sql, adapter: adapter)&#xA;    while let row = try rows.next() {&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;From a fetched row, we can build a player:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;        let player: Player = row[playerScope]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the SQL query, the team is joined with the &lt;code&gt;LEFT JOIN&lt;/code&gt; operator. This means that the team may be missing: its slice may contain team values, or it may only contain NULLs. When this happens, we don&#39;t want to build a Team record, and we thus load an &lt;em&gt;optional&lt;/em&gt; Team:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;        let team: Team? = row[teamScope]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;And finally, we can load the maximum score, assuming that the &#34;maxScore&#34; column is not ambiguous:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;        let maxScore: Int = row[&#34;maxScore&#34;]&#xA;        &#xA;        print(&#34;player: \(player)&#34;)&#xA;        print(&#34;team: \(team)&#34;)&#xA;        print(&#34;maxScore: \(maxScore)&#34;)&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt; In this chapter, we have learned:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA; &lt;ul&gt; &#xA;  &lt;li&gt;how to use &lt;code&gt;RangeRowAdapter&lt;/code&gt; to extract a specific table&#39;s columns into a &lt;em&gt;row slice&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;  &lt;li&gt;how to use &lt;code&gt;ScopeAdapter&lt;/code&gt; to gives access to several row slices through named scopes.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;  &lt;li&gt;how to use Row subscripting to extract records from rows, or optional records in order to deal with left joins.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Splitting Rows, the Record Way&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our introduction above has introduced important techniques. It uses &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#row-adapters&#34;&gt;row adapters&lt;/a&gt; in order to split rows. It uses Row subscripting in order to extract records from row slices.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;But we may want to make it more usable and robust:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;It&#39;s generally easier to consume records than raw rows.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Joined records not always need all columns from a table (see &lt;code&gt;TableRecord.databaseSelection&lt;/code&gt; in &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#columns-selected-by-a-request&#34;&gt;Columns Selected by a Request&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Building row adapters is long and error prone.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To address the first bullet, let&#39;s define a record that holds our player, optional team, and maximum score. Since it can decode database rows, it adopts the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#fetchablerecord-protocol&#34;&gt;FetchableRecord&lt;/a&gt; protocol:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct PlayerInfo {&#xA;    var player: Player&#xA;    var team: Team?&#xA;    var maxScore: Int&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;/// PlayerInfo can decode rows:&#xA;extension PlayerInfo: FetchableRecord {&#xA;    private enum Scopes {&#xA;        static let player = &#34;player&#34;&#xA;        static let team = &#34;team&#34;&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    init(row: Row) {&#xA;        player = row[Scopes.player]&#xA;        team = row[Scopes.team]&#xA;        maxScore = row[&#34;maxScore&#34;]&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now we write a method that returns a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#custom-requests&#34;&gt;custom request&lt;/a&gt;, and then build the fetching method on top of that request:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;extension PlayerInfo {&#xA;    /// The request for all player infos&#xA;    static func all() -&amp;gt; AdaptedFetchRequest&amp;lt;SQLRequest&amp;lt;PlayerInfo&amp;gt;&amp;gt; {&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To acknowledge that both Player and Team records may customize their selection of the &#34;player&#34; and &#34;team&#34; columns, we&#39;ll write our SQL in a slightly different way:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;        // Let Player and Team customize their selection:&#xA;        let request: SQLRequest&amp;lt;PlayerInfo&amp;gt; = &#34;&#34;&#34;&#xA;            SELECT&#xA;                \(columnsOf: Player.self), -- instead of player.*&#xA;                \(columnsOf: Team.self),   -- instead of team.*&#xA;                MAX(round.score) AS maxScore&#xA;            FROM player&#xA;            LEFT JOIN team ON ...&#xA;            LEFT JOIN round ON ...&#xA;            GROUP BY ...&#xA;            &#34;&#34;&#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Our SQL is no longer a regular String, but an &lt;code&gt;SQLRequest&amp;lt;PlayerInfo&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; which profits from &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/SQLInterpolation.md&#34;&gt;SQL Interpolation&lt;/a&gt;. Inside this request, &lt;code&gt;\(columnsOf: Player.self)&lt;/code&gt; outputs &lt;code&gt;player.*&lt;/code&gt;, unless Player defines a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#columns-selected-by-a-request&#34;&gt;customized selection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Now we need to build adapters.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We use the &lt;code&gt;splittingRowAdapters&lt;/code&gt; global function, whose job is precisely to build row adapters of desired widths:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;And since counting table columns require a database connection, we use the &lt;code&gt;adapted(_:)&lt;/code&gt; request method. It allows requests to adapt themselves right before execution, when a database connection is available.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;        return request.adapted { db in&#xA;            let adapters = try splittingRowAdapters(columnCounts: [&#xA;                Player.numberOfSelectedColumns(db),&#xA;                Team.numberOfSelectedColumns(db)])&#xA;            return ScopeAdapter([&#xA;                Scopes.player: adapters[0],&#xA;                Scopes.team: adapters[1]])&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;splittingRowAdapters&lt;/code&gt; returns as many adapters as necessary to fully split a row. In the example above, it returns &lt;em&gt;three&lt;/em&gt; adapters: one for player, one for team, and one for the remaining columns.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;And finally, we can define the fetching method:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;    /// Fetches all player infos&#xA;    static func fetchAll(_ db: Database) throws -&amp;gt; [PlayerInfo] {&#xA;        try all().fetchAll(db)&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;And when your app needs to fetch player infos, it now reads:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Fetch player infos&#xA;let playerInfos = try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    try PlayerInfo.fetchAll(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt; In this chapter, we have learned:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA; &lt;ul&gt; &#xA;  &lt;li&gt;how to define a &lt;code&gt;FetchableRecord&lt;/code&gt; record that consumes rows fetched from a joined query.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;  &lt;li&gt;how to use &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/SQLInterpolation.md&#34;&gt;SQL Interpolation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;code&gt;numberOfSelectedColumns&lt;/code&gt; in order to deal with nested record types that define custom selection.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;  &lt;li&gt;how to use &lt;code&gt;splittingRowAdapters&lt;/code&gt; in order to streamline the definition of row slices.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;  &lt;li&gt;how to gather all relevant methods and constants in a record type, fully responsible of its relationship with the database.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Splitting Rows, the Codable Way&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#codable-records&#34;&gt;Codable Records&lt;/a&gt; build on top of the standard Decodable protocol in order to decode database rows.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can consume complex joined queries with Codable records as well. As a demonstration, we&#39;ll rewrite the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#splitting-rows-the-record-way&#34;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt; sample code:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct Player: Decodable, FetchableRecord, TableRecord {&#xA;

           return ScopeAdapter([&#xA;                CodingKeys.player.stringValue: adapters[0],&#xA;                CodingKeys.team.stringValue: adapters[1]])&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    /// Fetches all player infos&#xA;

protocol and its associated &lt;code&gt;CodingKeys&lt;/code&gt; enum in order to dry up our code.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Database Changes Observation&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQLite notifies its host application of changes performed to the database, as well of transaction commits and rollbacks.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;GRDB puts this SQLite feature to some good use, and lets you observe the database in various ways:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#after-commit-hook&#34;&gt;After Commit Hook&lt;/a&gt;: Handle successful transactions one by one.&lt;/li&gt;

&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Database observation requires that a single &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-queues&#34;&gt;database queue&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-pools&#34;&gt;pool&lt;/a&gt; is kept open for all the duration of the database usage.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;After Commit Hook&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When your application needs to make sure a specific database transaction has been successfully committed before it executes some work, use the &lt;code&gt;Database.afterNextTransactionCommit(_:)&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Its closure argument is called right after database changes have been successfully written to disk:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    db.afterNextTransactionCommit { db in&#xA;        print(&#34;success&#34;)&#xA;    }&#xA;    ...&#xA;} // prints &#34;success&#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The closure runs in a protected dispatch queue, serialized with all database updates.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;This &#34;after commit hook&#34; helps synchronizing the database with other resources, such as files, or system sensors.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In the example below, a &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/corelocation/cllocationmanager&#34;&gt;location manager&lt;/a&gt; starts monitoring a CLRegion if and only if it has successfully been stored in the database:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;/// Inserts a region in the database, and start monitoring upon&#xA;/// successful insertion.&#xA;func startMonitoring(_ db: Database, region: CLRegion) throws {&#xA;    // Make sure database is inside a transaction&#xA;    try db.inSavepoint {&#xA;        &#xA;        // Save the region in the database&#xA;        try insert(...)&#xA;        &#xA;        // Start monitoring if and only if the insertion is&#xA;        // eventually committed&#xA;        db.afterNextTransactionCommit { _ in&#xA;            // locationManager prefers the main queue:&#xA;            DispatchQueue.main.async {&#xA;                locationManager.startMonitoring(for: region)&#xA;            }&#xA;        }&#xA;        &#xA;        return .commit&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The method above won&#39;t trigger the location manager if the transaction is eventually rollbacked (explicitly, or because of an error), as in the sample code below:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    // success&#xA;    try startMonitoring(db, region)&#xA;    &#xA;    // On error, the transaction is rollbacked, the region is not inserted, and&#xA;    // the location manager is not invoked.&#xA;    try failableMethod(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;ValueObservation&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ValueObservation tracks changes in database values&lt;/strong&gt;. It automatically notifies your application with fresh values whenever changes are committed in the database.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tracked changes are insertions, updates, and deletions that impact the tracked value, performed with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#the-query-interface&#34;&gt;query interface&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#sqlite-api&#34;&gt;raw SQL&lt;/a&gt;. This includes indirect changes triggered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_actions&#34;&gt;foreign keys actions&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtrigger.html&#34;&gt;SQL triggers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Some changes are not notified: changes to internal system tables (such as &lt;code&gt;sqlite\_master&lt;/code&gt;), and changes to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/withoutrowid.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;WITHOUT ROWID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tables.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ValueObservation is the preferred GRDB tool for keeping your user interface synchronized with the database.&lt;/strong&gt; See the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/DemoApps&#34;&gt;Demo Applications&lt;/a&gt;

This can be &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#specifying-the-region-tracked-by-valueobservation&#34;&gt;configured&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;By default, ValueObservation notifies the initial value, as well as eventual changes and errors, on the main thread, asynchronously. This can be &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservation-scheduling&#34;&gt;configured&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;ValueObservation may coalesce subsequent changes into a single notification.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;ValueObservation may notify consecutive identical values. You can filter out the undesired duplicates with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservationremoveduplicates&#34;&gt;removeDuplicates&lt;/a&gt; method.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;Starting an observation retains the database connection, until it is stopped. As long as the observation is active, the database connection won&#39;t be deallocated.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;The database observation stops when any of those conditions is met: &#xA;  &lt;ul&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;The cancellable returned by the &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; method is cancelled or deinitialized.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;li&gt;An error occurs.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/ul&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Take care that there are use cases that ValueObservation is unfit for. For example, your application may need to process absolutely all changes, and avoid any coalescing. It may also need to process changes before any further modifications are performed in the database file. In those cases, you need to track &lt;em&gt;individual transactions&lt;/em&gt;, not values. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#databaseregionobservation&#34;&gt;DatabaseRegionObservation&lt;/a&gt;. If you need to process uncommitted changes, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#transactionobserver-protocol&#34;&gt;TransactionObserver&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;ValueObservation Scheduling&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;By default, ValueObservation notifies the initial value, as well as eventual changes and errors, on the main thread, asynchronously:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// The default scheduling&#xA;let cancellable = observation.start(&#xA;    in: dbQueue,&#xA;    onError: { error in ... },                   // called asynchronously on the main thread&#xA;    onChange: { value in print(&#34;fresh value&#34;) }) // called asynchronously on the main thread&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can change this behavior by adding a &lt;code&gt;scheduling&lt;/code&gt; argument to the &lt;code&gt;start()&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, &lt;code&gt;scheduling: .immediate&lt;/code&gt; makes sure the initial value is notified immediately when the observation starts. It helps your application update the user interface without having to wait for any asynchronous notifications:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;class PlayersViewController: UIViewController {&#xA;    private var cancellable: DatabaseCancellable?&#xA;    &#xA;    override func viewWillAppear(_ animated: Bool) {&#xA;        super.viewWillAppear(animated)&#xA;        &#xA;        // Start observing the database&#xA;        let observation = ValueObservation.tracking(Player.fetchAll)&#xA;        cancellable = observation.start(&#xA;            in: dbQueue,&#xA;            scheduling: .immediate, // &amp;lt;- immediate scheduler&#xA;            onError: { error in ... },&#xA;            onChange: { [weak self] (players: [Player]) in&#xA;                guard let self = self else { return }&#xA;                self.updateView(players)&#xA;            })&#xA;        // &amp;lt;- Here the view has already been updated.&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    override func viewWillDisappear(_ animated: Bool) {&#xA;        super.viewWillDisappear(animated)&#xA;    &#xA;        // Stop observing the database&#xA;        cancellable?.cancel()&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    private func updateView(_ players: [Player]) { ... }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that the &lt;code&gt;.immediate&lt;/code&gt; scheduling requires that the observation starts from the main thread. A fatal error is raised otherwise.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The other built-in scheduler &lt;code&gt;.async(onQueue:)&lt;/code&gt; asynchronously schedules values and errors on the dispatch queue of your choice:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let queue: DispatchQueue = ...&#xA;let cancellable = observation.start(&#xA;    in: dbQueue,&#xA;    scheduling: .async(onQueue: queue)&#xA;    onError: { error in ... },                   // called asynchronously on queue&#xA;    onChange: { value in print(&#34;fresh value&#34;) }) // called asynchronously on queue&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;ValueObservation Operators&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Operators&lt;/strong&gt; are methods that transform and configure value observations so that they better fit the needs of your application.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservationmap&#34;&gt;ValueObservation.map&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservationremoveduplicates&#34;&gt;ValueObservation.removeDuplicates&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservationrequireswriteaccess&#34;&gt;ValueObservation.requiresWriteAccess&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Debugging Operators&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservationhandleevents&#34;&gt;ValueObservation.handleEvents&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservationprint&#34;&gt;ValueObservation.print&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;ValueObservation.map&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; operator transforms the values notified by a ValueObservation.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Turn an observation of Player? into an observation of UIImage?&#xA;let observation = ValueObservation&#xA;    .tracking { db in try Player.fetchOne(db, id: 42) }&#xA;    .map { player in player?.image }&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The transformation function does not block any database access. This makes the &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; operator a tool which helps reducing &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservation-performance&#34;&gt;database contention&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;ValueObservation.removeDuplicates&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;removeDuplicates()&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;removeDuplicates(by:)&lt;/code&gt; operators filter out consecutive equal values:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// An observation of distinct Player?&#xA;let observation = ValueObservation&#xA;    .tracking { db in try Player.fetchOne(db, id: 42) }&#xA;    .removeDuplicates()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: When the observed value does not adopt Equatable, and it is impractical to provide a custom comparison function, you can observe distinct raw database values such as &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#row-queries&#34;&gt;Row&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#databasevalue&#34;&gt;DatabaseValue&lt;/a&gt;, before converting them to the desired type. For example, the previous observation can be rewritten as below:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// An observation of distinct Player?&#xA;let request = Player.filter(id: 42)&#xA;let observation = ValueObservation&#xA;    .tracking { db in try Row.fetchOne(db, request) }&#xA;    .removeDuplicates() // Row adopts Equatable&#xA;    .map { row in row.map(Player.init(row:) }&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This technique is also available for requests that involve &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/AssociationsBasics.md&#34;&gt;Associations&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct TeamInfo: Decodable, FetchableRecord {&#xA;    var team: Team&#xA;    var players: [Player]&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// An observation of distinct [TeamInfo]&#xA;let request = Team.including(all: Team.players)&#xA;let observation = ValueObservation&#xA;    .tracking { db in try Row.fetchAll(db, request) }&#xA;    .removeDuplicates() // Row adopts Equatable&#xA;    .map { rows in rows.map(TeamInfo.init(row:) }&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;ValueObservation.requiresWriteAccess&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;requiresWriteAccess&lt;/code&gt; property is false by default. When true, a ValueObservation has a write access to the database, and its fetches are automatically wrapped in a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#transactions-and-savepoints&#34;&gt;savepoint&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;var observation = ValueObservation.tracking { db in&#xA;    // write access allowed&#xA;    ...&#xA;}&#xA;observation.requiresWriteAccess = true&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-pools&#34;&gt;database pool&lt;/a&gt;, this flag has a performance hit.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;ValueObservation.handleEvents&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;handleEvents&lt;/code&gt; operator lets your application observe the lifetime of a ValueObservation:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let observation = ValueObservation&#xA;    .tracking { db in ... }&#xA;    .handleEvents(&#xA;        willStart: {&#xA;            // The observation starts.&#xA;        },&#xA;        willFetch: {&#xA;            // The observation will perform a database fetch.&#xA;        },&#xA;        willTrackRegion: { databaseRegion in&#xA;            // The observation starts tracking a database region.&#xA;        },&#xA;        databaseDidChange: {&#xA;            // The observation was impacted by a database change.&#xA;        },&#xA;        didReceiveValue: { value in&#xA;            // A fresh value was observed.&#xA;            // NOTE: This closure runs on an unspecified DispatchQueue.&#xA;        },&#xA;        didFail: { error in&#xA;            // The observation completes with an error.&#xA;        },&#xA;        didCancel: {&#xA;            // The observation was cancelled.&#xA;        })&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservationprint&#34;&gt;ValueObservation.print&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;ValueObservation.print&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;print&lt;/code&gt; operator logs messages for all ValueObservation events.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let observation = ValueObservation&#xA;    .tracking { db in ... }&#xA;    .print()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See also &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservationhandleevents&#34;&gt;ValueObservation.handleEvents&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;ValueObservation Sharing&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#what-are-experimental-features&#34;&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;🔥&lt;/span&gt; EXPERIMENTAL&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sharing a ValueObservation allows several components of your app to be notified of database changes, in an efficient way.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;A shared observation spares database resources. For example, when a database change happens, a fresh value is fetched only once, and then notified to all subscriptions.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Usage:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// SharedValueObservation&amp;lt;[Player]&amp;gt;&#xA;let sharedObservation = ValueObservation&#xA;    .tracking { db in try Player.fetchAll(db) }&#xA;    .shared(in: dbQueue)&#xA;//  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&#xA;    &#xA;let cancellable = try sharedObservation.start(&#xA;    onError: { error in ... },&#xA;    onChange: { players: [Player] in&#xA;        print(&#34;fresh players: \(players)&#34;)&#xA;    })&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The sharing only applies if you start observing the database from the same &lt;code&gt;SharedValueObservation&lt;/code&gt; instance:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// NOT shared&#xA;let cancellable1 = ValueObservation.tracking { db in ... }.shared(in: dbQueue).start(...)&#xA;let cancellable2 = ValueObservation.tracking { db in ... }.shared(in: dbQueue).start(...)&#xA;&#xA;// Shared&#xA;let sharedObservation = ValueObservation.tracking { db in ... }.shared(in: dbQueue)&#xA;let cancellable1 = sharedObservation.start(...)&#xA;let cancellable2 = sharedObservation.start(...)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;By default, fresh values are dispatched asynchronously on the main queue. You can change this behavior (see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservation-scheduling&#34;&gt;ValueObservation Scheduling&lt;/a&gt; for more information):&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let sharedObservation = ValueObservation&#xA;    .tracking { db in try Player.fetchAll(db) }&#xA;    .shared(in: dbQueue, scheduling: .immediate)&#xA;//                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;A shared observation starts observing the database as soon as it is subscribed. You can choose if database observation should stop, or not, when its number of subscriptions drops down to zero, with the &lt;code&gt;extent&lt;/code&gt; parameter:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// The default: stops observing the database when the number of subscriptions &#xA;// drops down to zero, and restart database observation on the next subscription.&#xA;//&#xA;// Database errors can be recovered by resubscribing to the shared observation.&#xA;let sharedObservation = ValueObservation&#xA;    .tracking { db in try Player.fetchAll(db) }&#xA;    .shared(in: dbQueue, extent: .whileObserved)&#xA;//                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&#xA;&#xA;// Only stops observing the database when the shared observation is deinitialized,&#xA;// and all subscriptions are cancelled.&#xA;//&#xA;// This extent prevents the shared observation from recovering from database&#xA;// errors. To recover from database errors, create a new shared&#xA;// SharedValueObservation instance.&#xA;let sharedObservation = ValueObservation&#xA;    .tracking { db in try Player.fetchAll(db) }&#xA;    .shared(in: dbQueue, extent: .observationLifetime)&#xA;//                       ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;code&gt;ValueObservation&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SharedValueObservation&lt;/code&gt; are nearly identical, but there is a difference you should be aware of. &lt;code&gt;SharedValueObservation&lt;/code&gt; has no &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservation-operators&#34;&gt;operator&lt;/a&gt; such as &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;. As a replacement, you may, for example, use Combine apis:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let sharedObservation = ValueObservation.tracking { ... }.shared(in: dbQueue)&#xA;let cancellable = try sharedObservation&#xA;    .publisher() // Turn shared observation into a Combine Publisher&#xA;    .map { ... } // The map operator from Combine&#xA;    .sink(...)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Specifying the Region Tracked by ValueObservation&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;While the standard &lt;code&gt;ValueObservation.tracking { db in ... }&lt;/code&gt; method lets you track changes to a fetched value and receive any changes to it, sometimes your use case might require more granular control.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Consider a scenario where you&#39;d like to get a specific Player&#39;s row, but only when their &lt;code&gt;score&lt;/code&gt; column changes. You can use &lt;code&gt;tracking(region:fetch:)&lt;/code&gt; to do just that:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let observation = ValueObservation.tracking(&#xA;    // Define what database region constitutes a &#34;change&#34;&#xA;    region: Player.select(Column(&#34;score&#34;)).filter(id: 1),&#xA;    // Define what to fetch upon such change&#xA;    fetch: { db in try Player.fetchOne(db, id: 1) }&#xA;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This overload of &lt;code&gt;ValueObservation&lt;/code&gt; lets you entirely separate the &lt;strong&gt;observed region&lt;/strong&gt; from the &lt;strong&gt;fetched value&lt;/strong&gt; itself, providing utmost flexibility. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#the-databaseregionconvertible-protocol&#34;&gt;DatabaseRegionConvertible&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;ValueObservation Performance&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This chapter further describes runtime aspects of ValueObservation, and provides some optimization tips for demanding applications.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ValueObservation is triggered by database transactions that may modify the tracked value.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, if you track the maximum score of players, all transactions that impact the &lt;code&gt;score&lt;/code&gt; column of the &lt;code&gt;player&lt;/code&gt; database table (any update, insertion, or deletion) trigger the observation, even if the maximum score itself is not changed.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can filter out undesired duplicate notifications with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservationremoveduplicates&#34;&gt;removeDuplicates&lt;/a&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;ValueObservation can create database contention.&lt;/strong&gt; In other words, active observations take a toll on the constrained database resources. When triggered by impactful transactions, observations fetch fresh values, and can delay read and write database accesses of other application components.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When needed, you can help GRDB optimize observations and reduce database contention:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Stop observations when possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, if a UIViewController needs to display database values, it can start the observation in &lt;code&gt;viewWillAppear&lt;/code&gt;, and stop it in &lt;code&gt;viewWillDisappear&lt;/code&gt;. Check the sample code &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservation-scheduling&#34;&gt;above&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Share observations when possible.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;Each call to &lt;code&gt;ValueObservation.start&lt;/code&gt; method triggers independent values refreshes. When several components of your app are interested in the same value, consider &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservation-sharing&#34;&gt;sharing the observation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: Use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-pools&#34;&gt;database pool&lt;/a&gt;, because it can perform multi-threaded database accesses.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: When the observation processes some raw fetched values, use the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservationmap&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; operator:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Plain observation&#xA;let observation = ValueObservation.tracking { db -&amp;gt; MyValue in&#xA;    let players = try Player.fetchAll(db)&#xA;    return computeMyValue(players)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// Optimized observation&#xA;let observation = ValueObservation&#xA;    .tracking { db try Player.fetchAll(db) }&#xA;    .map { players in computeMyValue(players) }&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;map&lt;/code&gt; operator helps reducing database contention because it performs its job without blocking concurrent database reads.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;💡&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Tip&lt;/strong&gt;: When the observation tracks a constant database region, create an optimized observation with the &lt;code&gt;ValueObservation.trackingConstantRegion(_:)&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The optimization only kicks in when the observation is started from a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-pools&#34;&gt;database pool&lt;/a&gt;: fresh values are fetched concurrently, and do not block database writes.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;ValueObservation.trackingConstantRegion(_:)&lt;/code&gt; has a precondition: the observed requests must fetch from a single and constant database region. The tracked region is made of tables, columns, and, when possible, rowids of individual rows. All changes that happen outside of this region do not impact the observation.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Tracks the full &#39;player&#39; table (only)&#xA;let observation = ValueObservation.trackingConstantRegion { db -&amp;gt; [Player] in&#xA;    try Player.fetchAll(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// Tracks the row with id 42 in the &#39;player&#39; table (only)&#xA;let observation = ValueObservation.trackingConstantRegion { db -&amp;gt; Player? in&#xA;    try Player.fetchOne(db, id: 42)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// Tracks the &#39;score&#39; column in the &#39;player&#39; table (only)&#xA;let observation = ValueObservation.trackingConstantRegion { db -&amp;gt; Int? in&#xA;    try Player.select(max(Column(&#34;score&#34;))).fetchOne(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// Tracks both the &#39;player&#39; and &#39;team&#39; tables (only)&#xA;let observation = ValueObservation.trackingConstantRegion { db -&amp;gt; ([Team], [Player]) in&#xA;    let teams = try Team.fetchAll(db)&#xA;    let players = try Player.fetchAll(db)&#xA;    return (teams, players)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you want to observe a varying database region, make sure you use the plain &lt;code&gt;ValueObservation.tracking(_:)&lt;/code&gt; method instead, or else some changes will not be notified.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example, consider those three observations below that depend on some user preference. They all track a varying region, and must use &lt;code&gt;ValueObservation.tracking(_:)&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Does not always track the same row in the player table.&#xA;let observation = ValueObservation.tracking { db -&amp;gt; Player? in&#xA;    let pref = try Preference.fetchOne(db) ?? .default&#xA;    return try Player.fetchOne(db, id: pref.favoritePlayerId)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// Only tracks the &#39;user&#39; table if there are some blocked emails.&#xA;let observation = ValueObservation.tracking { db -&amp;gt; [User] in&#xA;    let pref = try Preference.fetchOne(db) ?? .default&#xA;    let blockedEmails = pref.blockedEmails&#xA;    return try User.filter(blockedEmails.contains(Column(&#34;email&#34;))).fetchAll(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// Sometimes tracks the &#39;food&#39; table, and sometimes the &#39;beverage&#39; table.&#xA;let observation = ValueObservation.tracking { db -&amp;gt; Int in&#xA;    let pref = try Preference.fetchOne(db) ?? .default&#xA;    switch pref.selection {&#xA;    case .food: return try Food.fetchCount(db)&#xA;    case .beverage: return try Beverage.fetchCount(db)&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;When you are in doubt, add the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservationprint&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;print()&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/a&gt; to your observation before starting it, and look in your application logs for lines that start with &lt;code&gt;tracked region&lt;/code&gt;. Make sure the printed database region covers the changes you expect to be tracked.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;  &lt;details&gt; &#xA;   &lt;summary&gt;Examples of tracked regions&lt;/summary&gt; &#xA;   &lt;ul&gt; &#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;empty&lt;/code&gt;: The empty region, which tracks nothing and never triggers the observation.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;player(*)&lt;/code&gt;: The full &lt;code&gt;player&lt;/code&gt; table&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;player(id,name)&lt;/code&gt;: The &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; columns of the &lt;code&gt;player&lt;/code&gt; table&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;player(id,name)[1]&lt;/code&gt;: The &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; columns of the row with id 1 in the &lt;code&gt;player&lt;/code&gt; table&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;    &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;player(*),preference(*)&lt;/code&gt;: Both the full &lt;code&gt;player&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;preference&lt;/code&gt; tables&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;   &lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/details&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;DatabaseRegionObservation&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DatabaseRegionObservation tracks changes in database &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#requests&#34;&gt;requests&lt;/a&gt;, and notifies each impactful &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#transactions-and-savepoints&#34;&gt;transaction&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Tracked changes are insertions, updates, and deletions that impact the tracked requests, performed with the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#the-query-interface&#34;&gt;query interface&lt;/a&gt;, or &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#sqlite-api&#34;&gt;raw SQL&lt;/a&gt;. This includes indirect changes triggered by &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/foreignkeys.html#fk_actions&#34;&gt;foreign keys actions&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/lang_createtrigger.html&#34;&gt;SQL triggers&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Some changes are not notified: changes to internal system tables (such as &lt;code&gt;sqlite_master&lt;/code&gt;), and changes to &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/withoutrowid.html&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;WITHOUT ROWID&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; tables.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;DatabaseRegionObservation calls your application right after changes have been committed in the database, and before any other thread had any opportunity to perform further changes. &lt;em&gt;This is a pretty strong guarantee, that most applications do not really need.&lt;/em&gt; Instead, most applications prefer to be notified with fresh values: make sure you check &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservation&#34;&gt;ValueObservation&lt;/a&gt; before using DatabaseRegionObservation.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;DatabaseRegionObservation Usage&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Define an observation by providing one or several requests to track:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Track all players&#xA;let observation = DatabaseRegionObservation(tracking: Player.all())&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Then start the observation from a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-queues&#34;&gt;database queue&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-pools&#34;&gt;pool&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let observer = try observation.start(in: dbQueue) { (db: Database) in&#xA;    print(&#34;Players were changed&#34;)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;And enjoy the changes notifications:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    try Player(name: &#34;Arthur&#34;).insert(db)&#xA;}&#xA;// Prints &#34;Players were changed&#34;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;By default, the observation lasts until the observer returned by the &lt;code&gt;start&lt;/code&gt; method is deinitialized. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#databaseregionobservationextent&#34;&gt;DatabaseRegionObservation.extent&lt;/a&gt; for more details.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also feed DatabaseRegionObservation with &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#databaseregion&#34;&gt;DatabaseRegion&lt;/a&gt;, or any type which conforms to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#the-databaseregionconvertible-protocol&#34;&gt;DatabaseRegionConvertible&lt;/a&gt; protocol.

For example, here is how an observer can focus on the changes that happen on the &#34;player&#34; database table:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;class PlayerObserver: TransactionObserver {&#xA;    func observes(eventsOfKind eventKind: DatabaseEventKind) -&amp;gt; Bool {&#xA;        // Only observe changes to the &#34;player&#34; table.&#xA;        return eventKind.tableName == &#34;player&#34;&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    func databaseDidChange(with event: DatabaseEvent) {&#xA;        // This method is only called for changes that happen to&#xA;        // the &#34;player&#34; table.&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Generally speaking, the &lt;code&gt;observes(eventsOfKind:)&lt;/code&gt; method can distinguish insertions from deletions and updates, and is also able to inspect the columns that are about to be changed:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;class PlayerScoreObserver: TransactionObserver {&#xA;    func observes(eventsOfKind eventKind: DatabaseEventKind) -&amp;gt; Bool {&#xA;        // Only observe changes to the &#34;score&#34; column of the &#34;player&#34; table.&#xA;        switch eventKind {&#xA;        case .insert(let tableName):&#xA;            return tableName == &#34;player&#34;&#xA;        case .delete(let tableName):&#xA;            return tableName == &#34;player&#34;&#xA;        case .update(let tableName, let columnNames):&#xA;            return tableName == &#34;player&#34; &amp;amp;&amp;amp; columnNames.contains(&#34;score&#34;)&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the &lt;code&gt;observes(eventsOfKind:)&lt;/code&gt; method returns false for all event kinds, the observer is still notified of commits and rollbacks (except during read-only database accesses):&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;class PureTransactionObserver: TransactionObserver {&#xA;    func observes(eventsOfKind eventKind: DatabaseEventKind) -&amp;gt; Bool {&#xA;        // Ignore all individual changes&#xA;        return false&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    func databaseDidChange(with event: DatabaseEvent) { /* Never called */ }&#xA;    func databaseWillCommit() throws { /* Called before commit */ }&#xA;    func databaseDidRollback(_ db: Database) { /* Called on rollback */ }&#xA;    func databaseDidCommit(_ db: Database) { /* Called on commit */ }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more information about event filtering, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#databaseregion&#34;&gt;DatabaseRegion&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Observation Extent&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can specify how long an observer is notified of database changes and transactions.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;remove(transactionObserver:)&lt;/code&gt; method explicitly stops notifications, at any time:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// From a database queue or pool:&#xA;dbQueue.remove(transactionObserver: observer)&#xA;&#xA;// From a database connection:&#xA;dbQueue.inDatabase { db in&#xA;    db.remove(transactionObserver: observer)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Alternatively, use the &lt;code&gt;extent&lt;/code&gt; parameter of the &lt;code&gt;add(transactionObserver:extent:)&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let observer = MyObserver()&#xA;&#xA;// On a database queue or pool:&#xA;dbQueue.add(transactionObserver: observer) // default extent&#xA;dbQueue.add(transactionObserver: observer, extent: .observerLifetime)&#xA;dbQueue.add(transactionObserver: observer, extent: .nextTransaction)&#xA;dbQueue.add(transactionObserver: observer, extent: .databaseLifetime)&#xA;&#xA;// On a database connection:&#xA;dbQueue.inDatabase { db in&#xA;    db.add(transactionObserver: ...)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;The default extent is &lt;code&gt;.observerLifetime&lt;/code&gt;: the database holds a weak reference to the observer, and the observation automatically ends when the observer is deinitialized. Meanwhile, observer is notified of all changes and transactions.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.nextTransaction&lt;/code&gt; activates the observer until the current or next transaction completes. The database keeps a strong reference to the observer until its &lt;code&gt;databaseDidCommit&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;databaseDidRollback&lt;/code&gt; method is eventually called. Hereafter the observer won&#39;t get any further notification.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;.databaseLifetime&lt;/code&gt; has the database retain and notify the observer until the database connection is closed.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, an observer may ignore all database changes until the end of the current transaction:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;class PlayerObserver: TransactionObserver {&#xA;    var playerTableWasModified = false&#xA;    &#xA;    func observes(eventsOfKind eventKind: DatabaseEventKind) -&amp;gt; Bool {&#xA;        eventKind.tableName == &#34;player&#34;&#xA;    }&#xA;    &#xA;    func databaseDidChange(with event: DatabaseEvent) {&#xA;        playerTableWasModified = true&#xA;        &#xA;        // It is pointless to keep on tracking further changes:&#xA;        stopObservingDatabaseChangesUntilNextTransaction()&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;After &lt;code&gt;stopObservingDatabaseChangesUntilNextTransaction()&lt;/code&gt;, the &lt;code&gt;databaseDidChange(with:)&lt;/code&gt; method will not be notified of any change for the remaining duration of the current transaction. This helps GRDB optimize database observation.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;DatabaseRegion&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;A &lt;code&gt;DatabaseRegion&lt;/code&gt; is a reunion of database tables, and combination of columns and rows (identified by their rowid):&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code&gt;|Table1 |   |Table2 |   |Table3 |   |Table4 |   |Table5 |&#xA;|-------|   |-------|   |-------|   |-------|   |-------|&#xA;|x|x|x|x|   |x| | | |   |x|x|x|x|   |x|x| |x|   | | | | |&#xA;|x|x|x|x|   |x| | | |   | | | | |   | | | | |   | |x| | |&#xA;|x|x|x|x|   |x| | | |   | | | | |   |x|x| |x|   | | | | |&#xA;|x|x|x|x|   |x| | | |   | | | | |   | | | | |   | | | | |&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;DatabaseRegion helps &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservation&#34;&gt;ValueObservation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#databaseregionobservation&#34;&gt;DatabaseRegionObservation&lt;/a&gt; track changes in the database through the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#transactionobserver-protocol&#34;&gt;TransactionObserver&lt;/a&gt; protocol.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Note that observing a database region spots &lt;em&gt;potential&lt;/em&gt; changes, not &lt;em&gt;actual&lt;/em&gt; changes in the results of a request.&lt;/strong&gt; A change is notified if and only if a statement has actually modified the tracked tables and columns by inserting, updating, or deleting a row.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, if you observe the region of &lt;code&gt;Player.select(max(Column(&#34;score&#34;)))&lt;/code&gt;, then you&#39;ll get be notified of all changes performed on the &lt;code&gt;score&lt;/code&gt; column of the &lt;code&gt;player&lt;/code&gt; table (updates, insertions and deletions), even if they do not modify the value of the maximum score. However, you will not get any notification for changes performed on other database tables, or updates to other columns of the player table.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more details, see the &lt;a href=&#34;https://groue.github.io/GRDB.swift/docs/5.24/Structs/DatabaseRegion.html&#34;&gt;reference&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;The DatabaseRegionConvertible Protocol&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;DatabaseRegionConvertible&lt;/strong&gt; is a protocol for all types that can turn into a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#databaseregion&#34;&gt;DatabaseRegion&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;protocol DatabaseRegionConvertible {&#xA;    func databaseRegion(_ db: Database) throws -&amp;gt; DatabaseRegion&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;All &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#requests&#34;&gt;requests&lt;/a&gt; adopt this protocol, and this allows them to be observed with &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#databaseregionobservation&#34;&gt;DatabaseRegionObservation&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservation&#34;&gt;ValueObservation&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// An observation triggered by all changes to the database&#xA;DatabaseRegionObservation(tracking: .fullDatabase)&#xA;&#xA;// An observation triggered by all changes to the player table&#xA;DatabaseRegionObservation(tracking: Table(&#34;player&#34;))&#xA;&#xA;// An observation triggered by all changes to the row with rowid 1 in the player table&#xA;DatabaseRegionObservation(tracking: Player.filter(id: 1))&#xA;&#xA;// An observation triggered by all changes to the score column of the player table&#xA;DatabaseRegionObservation(tracking: SQLRequest(&#34;SELECT score FROM player&#34;))&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Note that specifying a region as a request &lt;em&gt;does not run the request&lt;/em&gt;. In the above example, &lt;code&gt;Player.filter(id: 1)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SELECT score FROM player&lt;/code&gt; are never executed. They are only &lt;em&gt;compiled&lt;/em&gt; by SQLite, so that GRDB understands the tables, rows, and columns that constitute the database region.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Support for SQLite Pre-Update Hooks&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When SQLite is built with the SQLITE_ENABLE_PREUPDATE_HOOK option, TransactionObserverType gets an extra callback which lets you observe individual column values in the rows modified by a transaction:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;protocol TransactionObserverType : class {&#xA;    #if SQLITE_ENABLE_PREUPDATE_HOOK&#xA;    /// Notifies before a database change (insert, update, or delete)&#xA;    /// with change information (initial / final values for the row&#39;s&#xA;    /// columns).&#xA;    ///&#xA;    /// The event is only valid for the duration of this method call. If you&#xA;    /// need to keep it longer, store a copy: event.copy().&#xA;    func databaseWillChange(with event: DatabasePreUpdateEvent)&#xA;    #endif&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This extra API can be activated in two ways:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use the GRDB.swift CocoaPod with a custom compilation option, as below. It uses the system SQLite, which is compiled with SQLITE_ENABLE_PREUPDATE_HOOK support, but only on iOS 11.0+ (we don&#39;t know the minimum version of macOS, tvOS, watchOS):&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ruby&#34;&gt;pod &#39;GRDB.swift&#39;&#xA;platform :ios, &#39;11.0&#39; # or above&#xA;&#xA;post_install do |installer|&#xA;  installer.pods_project.targets.select { |target| target.name == &#34;GRDB.swift&#34; }.each do |target|&#xA;    target.build_configurations.each do |config|&#xA;      # Enable extra GRDB APIs&#xA;      config.build_settings[&#39;OTHER_SWIFT_FLAGS&#39;] = &#34;$(inherited) -D SQLITE_ENABLE_PREUPDATE_HOOK&#34;&#xA;      # Enable extra SQLite APIs&#xA;      config.build_settings[&#39;GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS&#39;] = &#34;$(inherited) GRDB_SQLITE_ENABLE_PREUPDATE_HOOK=1&#34;&#xA;    end&#xA;  end&#xA;end&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;⚠&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt;: make sure you use the right platform version! You will get runtime errors on devices with a lower version.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;  &lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA;   &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: the &lt;code&gt;GRDB_SQLITE_ENABLE_PREUPDATE_HOOK=1&lt;/code&gt; option in &lt;code&gt;GCC_PREPROCESSOR_DEFINITIONS&lt;/code&gt; defines some C function prototypes that are lacking from the system &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;sqlite3.h&amp;gt;&lt;/code&gt; header. When Xcode eventually ships with an SDK that includes a complete header, you may get a compiler error about duplicate function definitions. When this happens, just remove this &lt;code&gt;GRDB_SQLITE_ENABLE_PREUPDATE_HOOK=1&lt;/code&gt; option.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;  &lt;/blockquote&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;Use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/CustomSQLiteBuilds.md&#34;&gt;custom SQLite build&lt;/a&gt; and activate the &lt;code&gt;SQLITE_ENABLE_PREUPDATE_HOOK&lt;/code&gt; compilation option.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;h1&gt;Encryption&lt;/h1&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;GRDB can encrypt your database with &lt;a href=&#34;http://sqlcipher.net&#34;&gt;SQLCipher&lt;/a&gt; v3.4+.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Use &lt;a href=&#34;http://cocoapods.org/&#34;&gt;CocoaPods&lt;/a&gt;, and specify in your &lt;code&gt;Podfile&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-ruby&#34;&gt;# GRDB with SQLCipher 4&#xA;pod &#39;GRDB.swift/SQLCipher&#39;&#xA;pod &#39;SQLCipher&#39;, &#39;~&amp;gt; 4.0&#39;&#xA;&#xA;# GRDB with SQLCipher 3&#xA;pod &#39;GRDB.swift/SQLCipher&#39;&#xA;pod &#39;SQLCipher&#39;, &#39;~&amp;gt; 3.4&#39;&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Make sure you remove any existing &lt;code&gt;pod &#39;GRDB.swift&#39;&lt;/code&gt; from your Podfile. &lt;code&gt;GRDB.swift/SQLCipher&lt;/code&gt; must be the only active GRDB pod in your whole project, or you will face linker or runtime errors, due to the conflicts between SQLCipher and the system SQLite.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#creating-or-opening-an-encrypted-database&#34;&gt;Creating or Opening an Encrypted Database&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#changing-the-passphrase-of-an-encrypted-database&#34;&gt;Changing the Passphrase of an Encrypted Database&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#exporting-a-database-to-an-encrypted-database&#34;&gt;Exporting a Database to an Encrypted Database&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#security-considerations&#34;&gt;Security Considerations&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Creating or Opening an Encrypted Database&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You create and open an encrypted database&lt;/strong&gt; by providing a passphrase to your &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-connections&#34;&gt;database connection&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;var config = Configuration()&#xA;config.prepareDatabase { db in&#xA;    try db.usePassphrase(&#34;secret&#34;)&#xA;}&#xA;let dbQueue = try DatabaseQueue(path: dbPath, configuration: config)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is also in &lt;code&gt;prepareDatabase&lt;/code&gt; that you perform other &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/sqlcipher/sqlcipher-api/&#34;&gt;SQLCipher configuration steps&lt;/a&gt; that must happen early in the lifetime of a SQLCipher connection. For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;var config = Configuration()&#xA;config.prepareDatabase { db in&#xA;    try db.usePassphrase(&#34;secret&#34;)&#xA;    try db.execute(sql: &#34;PRAGMA cipher_page_size = ...&#34;)&#xA;    try db.execute(sql: &#34;PRAGMA kdf_iter = ...&#34;)&#xA;}&#xA;let dbQueue = try DatabaseQueue(path: dbPath, configuration: config)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you want to open an existing SQLCipher 3 database with SQLCipher 4, you may want to run the &lt;code&gt;cipher_compatibility&lt;/code&gt; pragma:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Open an SQLCipher 3 database with SQLCipher 4&#xA;var config = Configuration()&#xA;config.prepareDatabase { db in&#xA;    try db.usePassphrase(&#34;secret&#34;)&#xA;    try db.execute(sql: &#34;PRAGMA cipher_compatibility = 3&#34;)&#xA;}&#xA;let dbQueue = try DatabaseQueue(path: dbPath, configuration: config)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.zetetic.net/blog/2018/11/30/sqlcipher-400-release/&#34;&gt;SQLCipher 4.0.0 Release&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://discuss.zetetic.net/t/upgrading-to-sqlcipher-4/3283&#34;&gt;Upgrading to SQLCipher 4&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Changing the Passphrase of an Encrypted Database&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can change the passphrase&lt;/strong&gt; of an already encrypted database.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-queues&#34;&gt;database queue&lt;/a&gt;, open the database with the old passphrase, and then apply the new passphrase:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    try db.changePassphrase(&#34;newSecret&#34;)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you use a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-pools&#34;&gt;database pool&lt;/a&gt;, make sure that no concurrent read can happen by changing the passphrase within the &lt;code&gt;barrierWriteWithoutTransaction&lt;/code&gt; block. You must also ensure all future reads open a new database connection by calling the &lt;code&gt;invalidateReadOnlyConnections&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbPool.barrierWriteWithoutTransaction { db in&#xA;    try db.changePassphrase(&#34;newSecret&#34;)&#xA;    dbPool.invalidateReadOnlyConnections()&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: When an application wants to keep on using a database queue or pool after the passphrase has changed, it is responsible for providing the correct passphrase to the &lt;code&gt;usePassphrase&lt;/code&gt; method called in the database preparation function. Consider:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// WRONG: this won&#39;t work across a passphrase change&#xA;let passphrase = try getPassphrase()&#xA;var config = Configuration()&#xA;config.prepareDatabase { db in&#xA;    try db.usePassphrase(passphrase)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// CORRECT: get the latest passphrase when it is needed&#xA;var config = Configuration()&#xA;config.prepareDatabase { db in&#xA;    let passphrase = try getPassphrase()&#xA;    try db.usePassphrase(passphrase)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: The &lt;code&gt;DatabasePool.barrierWriteWithoutTransaction&lt;/code&gt; method does not prevent &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/Documentation/Concurrency.md#database-snapshots&#34;&gt;database snapshots&lt;/a&gt; from accessing the database during the passphrase change, or after the new passphrase has been applied to the database. Those database accesses may throw errors. Applications should provide their own mechanism for invalidating open snapshots before the passphrase is changed.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: Instead of changing the passphrase &#34;in place&#34; as described here, you can also export the database in a new encrypted database that uses the new passphrase. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#exporting-a-database-to-an-encrypted-database&#34;&gt;Exporting a Database to an Encrypted Database&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Exporting a Database to an Encrypted Database&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Providing a passphrase won&#39;t encrypt a clear-text database that already exists, though. SQLCipher can&#39;t do that, and you will get an error instead: &lt;code&gt;SQLite error 26: file is encrypted or is not a database&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Instead, create a new encrypted database, at a distinct location, and export the content of the existing database. This can both encrypt a clear-text database, or change the passphrase of an encrypted database.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The technique to do that is &lt;a href=&#34;https://discuss.zetetic.net/t/how-to-encrypt-a-plaintext-sqlite-database-to-use-sqlcipher-and-avoid-file-is-encrypted-or-is-not-a-database-errors/868/1&#34;&gt;documented&lt;/a&gt; by SQLCipher.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;With GRDB, it gives:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// The existing database&#xA;let existingDBQueue = try DatabaseQueue(path: &#34;/path/to/existing.db&#34;)&#xA;&#xA;// The new encrypted database, at some distinct location:&#xA;var config = Configuration()&#xA;config.prepareDatabase { db in&#xA;    try db.usePassphrase(&#34;secret&#34;)&#xA;}&#xA;let newDBQueue = try DatabaseQueue(path: &#34;/path/to/new.db&#34;, configuration: config)&#xA;&#xA;try existingDBQueue.inDatabase { db in&#xA;    try db.execute(&#xA;        sql: &#34;&#34;&#34;&#xA;            ATTACH DATABASE ? AS encrypted KEY ?;&#xA;            SELECT sqlcipher_export(&#39;encrypted&#39;);&#xA;            DETACH DATABASE encrypted;&#xA;            &#34;&#34;&#34;,&#xA;        arguments: [newDBQueue.path, &#34;secret&#34;])&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// Now the export is completed, and the existing database can be deleted.&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Security Considerations&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Managing the lifetime of the passphrase string&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;It is recommended to avoid keeping the passphrase in memory longer than necessary. To do this, make sure you load the passphrase from the &lt;code&gt;prepareDatabase&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// NOT RECOMMENDED: this keeps the passphrase in memory longer than necessary&#xA;let passphrase = try getPassphrase()&#xA;var config = Configuration()&#xA;config.prepareDatabase { db in&#xA;    try db.usePassphrase(passphrase)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// RECOMMENDED: only load the passphrase when it is needed&#xA;var config = Configuration()&#xA;config.prepareDatabase { db in&#xA;    let passphrase = try getPassphrase()&#xA;    try db.usePassphrase(passphrase)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This technique helps manages the lifetime of the passphrase, although keep in mind that the content of a String may remain intact in memory long after the object has been released.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For even better control over the lifetime of the passphrase in memory, use a Data object which natively provides the &lt;code&gt;resetBytes&lt;/code&gt; function.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// RECOMMENDED: only load the passphrase when it is needed and reset its content immediately after use&#xA;var config = Configuration()&#xA;config.prepareDatabase { db in&#xA;    let passphrase = try getPassphraseData() // Data&#xA;    defer {&#xA;        passphrase.resetBytes(in: 0..&amp;lt;data.count)&#xA;    }&#xA;    try db.usePassphrase(passphrase)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Some demanding users will want to go further, and manage the lifetime of the raw passphrase bytes. See below.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Managing the lifetime of the passphrase bytes&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;GRDB offers convenience methods for providing the database passphrases as Swift strings: &lt;code&gt;usePassphrase(_:)&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;changePassphrase(_:)&lt;/code&gt;. Those methods don&#39;t keep the passphrase String in memory longer than necessary. But they are as secure as the standard String type: the lifetime of actual passphrase bytes in memory is not under control.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you want to precisely manage the passphrase bytes, talk directly to SQLCipher, using its raw C functions.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;var config = Configuration()&#xA;config.prepareDatabase { db in&#xA;    ... // Carefully load passphrase bytes&#xA;    let code = sqlite3_key(db.sqliteConnection, /* passphrase bytes */)&#xA;    ... // Carefully dispose passphrase bytes&#xA;    guard code == SQLITE_OK else {&#xA;        throw DatabaseError(&#xA;            resultCode: ResultCode(rawValue: code), &#xA;            message: db.lastErrorMessage)&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;let dbQueue = try DatabaseQueue(path: dbPath, configuration: config)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h4&gt;Passphrase availability vs. Database availability&lt;/h4&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the passphrase is securely stored in the system keychain, your application can protect it using the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/documentation/security/ksecattraccessible&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;kSecAttrAccessible&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt; attribute.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Such protection prevents GRDB from creating SQLite connections when the passphrase is not available:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;var config = Configuration()&#xA;config.prepareDatabase { db in&#xA;    let passphrase = try loadPassphraseFromSystemKeychain()&#xA;    try db.usePassphrase(passphrase)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// Success if and only if the passphrase is available&#xA;let dbQueue = try DatabaseQueue(path: dbPath, configuration: config)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the same reason, &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-pools&#34;&gt;database pools&lt;/a&gt;, which open SQLite connections on demand, may fail at any time as soon as the passphrase becomes unavailable:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Success if and only if the passphrase is available&#xA;let dbPool = try DatabasePool(path: dbPath, configuration: config)&#xA;&#xA;// May fail if passphrase has turned unavailable&#xA;try dbPool.read { ... }&#xA;&#xA;// May trigger value observation failure if passphrase has turned unavailable&#xA;try dbPool.write { ... }&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Because DatabasePool maintains a pool of long-lived SQLite connections, some database accesses will use an existing connection, and succeed. And some other database accesses will fail, as soon as the pool wants to open a new connection. It is impossible to predict which accesses will succeed or fail.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For the same reason, a database queue, which also maintains a long-lived SQLite connection, will remain available even after the passphrase has turned unavailable.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Applications are thus responsible for protecting database accesses when the passphrase is unavailable. To this end, they can use &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#data-protection&#34;&gt;Data Protection&lt;/a&gt;. They can also destroy their instances of database queue or pool when the passphrase becomes unavailable.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Backup&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can backup (copy) a database into another.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Backups can for example help you copying an in-memory database to and from a database file when you implement NSDocument subclasses.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let source: DatabaseQueue = ...      // or DatabasePool&#xA;let destination: DatabaseQueue = ... // or DatabasePool&#xA;try source.backup(to: destination)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;backup&lt;/code&gt; method blocks the current thread until the destination database contains the same contents as the source database.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the source is a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-pools&#34;&gt;database pool&lt;/a&gt;, concurrent writes can happen during the backup. Those writes may, or may not, be reflected in the backup, but they won&#39;t trigger any error.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;code&gt;Database&lt;/code&gt; has an analogous &lt;code&gt;backup&lt;/code&gt; method.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let source: DatabaseQueue = ...      // or DatabasePool&#xA;let destination: DatabaseQueue = ... // or DatabasePool&#xA;try source.write { sourceDb in&#xA;    try destination.barrierWriteWithoutTransaction { destDb in&#xA;        try sourceDb.backup(to: destDb)&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This method allows for the choice of source and destination &lt;code&gt;Database&lt;/code&gt; handles with which to backup the database.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Backup Progress Reporting&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;backup&lt;/code&gt; methods take optional &lt;code&gt;pagesPerStep&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt; parameters. Together these parameters can be used to track a database backup in progress and abort an incomplete backup.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When &lt;code&gt;pagesPerStep&lt;/code&gt; is provided, the database backup is performed in &lt;em&gt;steps&lt;/em&gt;. At each step, no more than &lt;code&gt;pagesPerStep&lt;/code&gt; database pages are copied from the source to the destination. The backup proceeds one step at a time until all pages have been copied.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When a &lt;code&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt; callback is provided, &lt;code&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt; is called after every backup step, including the last. Even if a non-default &lt;code&gt;pagesPerStep&lt;/code&gt; is specified or the backup is otherwise completed in a single step, the &lt;code&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt; callback will be called.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try source.backup(&#xA;    to: destination,&#xA;    pagesPerStep: ...)&#xA;    { backupProgress in&#xA;       print(&#34;Database backup progress:&#34;, backupProgress)&#xA;    }&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Aborting an Incomplete Backup&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If a call to &lt;code&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt; throws when &lt;code&gt;backupProgress.isComplete == false&lt;/code&gt;, the backup will be aborted and the error rethrown. However, if a call to &lt;code&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt; throws when &lt;code&gt;backupProgress.isComplete == true&lt;/code&gt;, the backup is unaffected and the error is silently ignored.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;⚠&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt;: Passing non-default values of &lt;code&gt;pagesPerStep&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;progress&lt;/code&gt; to the backup methods is an advanced API intended to provide additional capabilities to expert users. GRDB&#39;s backup API provides a faithful, low-level wrapper to the underlying SQLite online backup API. GRDB&#39;s documentation is not a comprehensive substitute for the official SQLite &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/backup_finish.html&#34;&gt;documentation of their backup API&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Interrupt a Database&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The &lt;code&gt;interrupt()&lt;/code&gt; method&lt;/strong&gt; causes any pending database operation to abort and return at its earliest opportunity.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;It can be called from any thread.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;dbQueue.interrupt()&#xA;dbPool.interrupt()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;A call to &lt;code&gt;interrupt()&lt;/code&gt; that occurs when there are no running SQL statements is a no-op and has no effect on SQL statements that are started after &lt;code&gt;interrupt()&lt;/code&gt; returns.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;A database operation that is interrupted will throw a DatabaseError with code &lt;code&gt;SQLITE_INTERRUPT&lt;/code&gt;. If the interrupted SQL operation is an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE that is inside an explicit transaction, then the entire transaction will be rolled back automatically. If the rolled back transaction was started by a transaction-wrapping method such as &lt;code&gt;DatabaseWriter.write&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;Database.inTransaction&lt;/code&gt;, then all database accesses will throw a DatabaseError with code &lt;code&gt;SQLITE_ABORT&lt;/code&gt; until the wrapping method returns.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    try Player(...).insert(db)     // throws SQLITE_INTERRUPT&#xA;    try Player(...).insert(db)     // not executed&#xA;}                                  // throws SQLITE_INTERRUPT&#xA;&#xA;try dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    do {&#xA;        try Player(...).insert(db) // throws SQLITE_INTERRUPT&#xA;    } catch { }&#xA;}                                  // throws SQLITE_ABORT&#xA;&#xA;try dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    do {&#xA;        try Player(...).insert(db) // throws SQLITE_INTERRUPT&#xA;    } catch { }&#xA;    try Player(...).insert(db)     // throws SQLITE_ABORT&#xA;}                                  // throws SQLITE_ABORT&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can catch both &lt;code&gt;SQLITE_INTERRUPT&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;SQLITE_ABORT&lt;/code&gt; errors:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;do {&#xA;    try dbPool.write { db in ... }&#xA;} catch DatabaseError.SQLITE_INTERRUPT, DatabaseError.SQLITE_ABORT {&#xA;    // Oops, the database was interrupted.&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/interrupt.html&#34;&gt;Interrupt A Long-Running Query&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Avoiding SQL Injection&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;SQL injection is a technique that lets an attacker nuke your database.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/exploits_of_a_mom.png&#34; alt=&#34;XKCD: Exploits of a Mom&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://xkcd.com/327/&#34;&gt;https://xkcd.com/327/&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Here is an example of code that is vulnerable to SQL injection:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// BAD BAD BAD&#xA;let id = 1&#xA;let name = textField.text&#xA;try dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    try db.execute(sql: &#34;UPDATE students SET name = &#39;\(name)&#39; WHERE id = \(id)&#34;)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the user enters a funny string like &lt;code&gt;Robert&#39;; DROP TABLE students; --&lt;/code&gt;, SQLite will see the following SQL, and drop your database table instead of updating a name as intended:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-sql&#34;&gt;UPDATE students SET name = &#39;Robert&#39;;&#xA;DROP TABLE students;&#xA;--&#39; WHERE id = 1&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To avoid those problems, &lt;strong&gt;never embed raw values in your SQL queries&lt;/strong&gt;. The only correct technique is to provide &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#executing-updates&#34;&gt;arguments&lt;/a&gt; to your raw SQL queries:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let name = textField.text&#xA;try dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    // Good&#xA;    try db.execute(&#xA;        sql: &#34;UPDATE students SET name = ?

Here are a few examples:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The code asks for a non-optional value, when the database contains NULL:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// fatal error: could not convert NULL to String.&#xA;let name: String = row[&#34;name&#34;]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Solution: fix the contents of the database, use &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#create-tables&#34;&gt;NOT NULL constraints&lt;/a&gt;, or load an optional:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let name: String? = row[&#34;name&#34;]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Conversion from database value to Swift type fails:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// fatal error: could not convert &#34;Mom’s birthday&#34; to Date.&#xA;let date: Date = row[&#34;date&#34;]&#xA;&#xA;// fatal error: could not convert &#34;&#34; to URL.&#xA;let url: URL = row[&#34;url&#34;]&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Solution: fix the contents of the database, or use &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#databasevalue&#34;&gt;DatabaseValue&lt;/a&gt; to handle all possible cases:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let dbValue: DatabaseValue = row[&#34;date&#34;]&#xA;if dbValue.isNull {&#xA;    // Handle NULL&#xA;} else if let date = Date.fromDatabaseValue(dbValue) {&#xA;    // Handle valid date&#xA;} else {&#xA;    // Handle invalid date&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The database can&#39;t guarantee that the code does what it says:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// fatal error: table player has no unique index on column email&#xA;try Player.deleteOne(db, key: [&#34;email&#34;: &#34;arthur@example.com&#34;])&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Solution: add a unique index to the player.email column, or use the &lt;code&gt;deleteAll&lt;/code&gt; method to make it clear that you may delete more than one row:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try Player.filter(Column(&#34;email&#34;) == &#34;arthur@example.com&#34;).deleteAll(db)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt; &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Database connections are not reentrant:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// fatal error: Database methods are not reentrant.&#xA;dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;    dbQueue.write { db in&#xA;        ...&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;p&gt;Solution: avoid reentrancy, and instead pass a database connection along.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How to Deal with Untrusted Inputs&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s consider the code below:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let sql = &#34;SELECT ...&#34;&#xA;&#xA;// Some untrusted arguments for the query&#xA;let arguments: [String: Any] = ...&#xA;let rows = try Row.fetchCursor(db, sql: sql, arguments: StatementArguments(arguments))&#xA;&#xA;while let row = try rows.next() {&#xA;    // Some untrusted database value:&#xA;    let date: Date? = row[0]&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;It has two opportunities to throw fatal errors:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Untrusted arguments&lt;/strong&gt;: The dictionary may contain values that do not conform to the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#values&#34;&gt;DatabaseValueConvertible protocol&lt;/a&gt;, or may miss keys required by the statement.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Untrusted database content&lt;/strong&gt;: The row may contain a non-null value that can&#39;t be turned into a date.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;In such a situation, you can still avoid fatal errors by exposing and handling each failure point, one level down in the GRDB API:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Untrusted arguments&#xA;if let arguments = StatementArguments(arguments) {&#xA;    let statement = try db.makeStatement(sql: sql)&#xA;    try statement.setArguments(arguments)&#xA;    &#xA;    var cursor = try Row.fetchCursor(statement)&#xA;    while let row = try iterator.next() {&#xA;        // Untrusted database content&#xA;        let dbValue: DatabaseValue = row[0]&#xA;        if dbValue.isNull {&#xA;            // Handle NULL&#xA;        if let date = Date.fromDatabaseValue(dbValue) {&#xA;            // Handle valid date&#xA;        } else {&#xA;            // Handle invalid date&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#prepared-statements&#34;&gt;prepared statements&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#databasevalue&#34;&gt;DatabaseValue&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Error Log&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;SQLite can be configured to invoke a callback function containing an error code and a terse error message whenever anomalies occur.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This global error callback must be configured early in the lifetime of your application:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;Database.logError = { (resultCode, message) in&#xA;    NSLog(&#34;%@&#34;, &#34;SQLite error \(resultCode): \(message)&#34;)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;⚠&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt;: Database.logError must be set before any database connection is opened. This includes the connections that your application opens with GRDB, but also connections opened by other tools, such as third-party libraries. Setting it after a connection has been opened is an SQLite misuse, and has no effect.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://sqlite.org/errlog.html&#34;&gt;The Error And Warning Log&lt;/a&gt; for more information.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Unicode&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;SQLite lets you store unicode strings in the database.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;However, SQLite does not provide any unicode-aware string transformations or comparisons.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Unicode functions&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The &lt;code&gt;UPPER&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;LOWER&lt;/code&gt; built-in SQLite functions are not unicode-aware:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// &#34;JéRôME&#34;&#xA;try String.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT UPPER(&#39;Jérôme&#39;)&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;GRDB extends SQLite with &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#custom-sql-functions-and-aggregates&#34;&gt;SQL functions&lt;/a&gt; that call the Swift built-in string functions &lt;code&gt;capitalized&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;lowercased&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;uppercased&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;localizedCapitalized&lt;/code&gt;, &lt;code&gt;localizedLowercased&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;localizedUppercased&lt;/code&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// &#34;JÉRÔME&#34;&#xA;let uppercased = DatabaseFunction.uppercase&#xA;try String.fetchOne(db, sql: &#34;SELECT \(uppercased.name)(&#39;Jérôme&#39;)&#34;)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those unicode-aware string functions are also readily available in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#sql-functions&#34;&gt;query interface&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;Player.select(nameColumn.uppercased)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;String Comparison&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;SQLite compares strings in many occasions: when you sort rows according to a string column, or when you use a comparison operator such as &lt;code&gt;=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The comparison result comes from a &lt;em&gt;collating function&lt;/em&gt;, or &lt;em&gt;collation&lt;/em&gt;. SQLite comes with three built-in collations that do not support Unicode: &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/datatype3.html#collation&#34;&gt;binary, nocase, and rtrim&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;GRDB comes with five extra collations that leverage unicode-aware comparisons based on the standard Swift String comparison functions and operators:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;unicodeCompare&lt;/code&gt; (uses the built-in &lt;code&gt;&amp;lt;=&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;==&lt;/code&gt; Swift operators)&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;caseInsensitiveCompare&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;localizedCompare&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;localizedStandardCompare&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;A collation can be applied to a table column. All comparisons involving this column will then automatically trigger the comparison function:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try db.create(table: &#34;player&#34;) { t in&#xA;    // Guarantees case-insensitive email unicity&#xA;    t.column(&#34;email&#34;, .text).unique().collate(.nocase)&#xA;    &#xA;    // Sort names in a localized case insensitive way&#xA;    t.column(&#34;name&#34;, .text).collate(.localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// Players are sorted in a localized case insensitive way:&#xA;let players = try Player.order(nameColumn).fetchAll(db)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;⚠&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Warning&lt;/strong&gt;: SQLite &lt;em&gt;requires&lt;/em&gt; host applications to provide the definition of any collation other than binary, nocase and rtrim. When a database file has to be shared or migrated to another SQLite library of platform (such as the Android version of your application), make sure you provide a compatible collation.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you can&#39;t or don&#39;t want to define the comparison behavior of a column (see warning above), you can still use an explicit collation in SQL requests and in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#the-query-interface&#34;&gt;query interface&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let collation = DatabaseCollation.localizedCaseInsensitiveCompare&#xA;let players = try Player.fetchAll(db,&#xA;    sql: &#34;SELECT * FROM player ORDER BY name COLLATE \(collation.name))&#34;)&#xA;let players = try Player.order(nameColumn.collating(collation)).fetchAll(db)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You can also define your own collations&lt;/strong&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let collation = DatabaseCollation(&#34;customCollation&#34;) { (lhs, rhs) -&amp;gt; NSComparisonResult in&#xA;    // return the comparison of lhs and rhs strings.&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// Make the collation available to a database connection&#xA;var config = Configuration()&#xA;config.prepareDatabase { db in&#xA;    db.add(collation: collation)&#xA;}&#xA;let dbQueue = try DatabaseQueue(path: dbPath, configuration: config)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Memory Management&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Both SQLite and GRDB use non-essential memory that help them perform better.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can reclaim this memory with the &lt;code&gt;releaseMemory&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Release as much memory as possible.&#xA;dbQueue.releaseMemory()&#xA;dbPool.releaseMemory()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This method blocks the current thread until all current database accesses are completed, and the memory collected.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Memory Management on iOS&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The iOS operating system likes applications that do not consume much memory.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-queues&#34;&gt;Database queues&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-pools&#34;&gt;pools&lt;/a&gt; automatically call the &lt;code&gt;releaseMemory&lt;/code&gt; method when the application receives a memory warning, and when the application enters background.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;Data Protection&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/iPhone/Conceptual/iPhoneOSProgrammingGuide/StrategiesforImplementingYourApp/StrategiesforImplementingYourApp.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40007072-CH5-SW21&#34;&gt;Data Protection&lt;/a&gt; lets you protect files so that they are encrypted and unavailable until the device is unlocked.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Data protection can be enabled &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/AddingCapabilities/AddingCapabilities.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH26-SW30&#34;&gt;globally&lt;/a&gt; for all files created by an application.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can also explicitly protect a database, by configuring its enclosing &lt;em&gt;directory&lt;/em&gt;. This will not only protect the database file, but also all &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/tempfiles.html&#34;&gt;temporary files&lt;/a&gt; created by SQLite (including the persistent &lt;code&gt;.shm&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;.wal&lt;/code&gt; files created by &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-pools&#34;&gt;database pools&lt;/a&gt;).&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example, to explicitly use &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/fileprotectiontype/1616200-complete&#34;&gt;complete&lt;/a&gt; protection:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Paths&#xA;let fileManager = FileManager.default&#xA;let directoryURL = try fileManager&#xA;    .url(for: .applicationSupportDirectory, in: .userDomainMask, appropriateFor: nil, create: true)&#xA;    .appendingPathComponent(&#34;database&#34;, isDirectory: true)&#xA;let databaseURL = directoryURL.appendingPathComponent(&#34;db.sqlite&#34;)&#xA;&#xA;// Create directory if needed&#xA;var isDirectory: ObjCBool = false&#xA;if !fileManager.fileExists(atPath: directoryURL.path, isDirectory: &amp;amp;isDirectory) {&#xA;    try fileManager.createDirectory(atPath: directoryURL.path, withIntermediateDirectories: false)&#xA;} else if !isDirectory.boolValue {&#xA;    throw NSError(domain: NSCocoaErrorDomain, code: NSFileWriteFileExistsError, userInfo: nil)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;// Enable data protection&#xA;try fileManager.setAttributes([.protectionKey : FileProtectionType.complete], ofItemAtPath: directoryURL.path)&#xA;&#xA;// Open database&#xA;let dbQueue = try DatabaseQueue(path: databaseURL.path)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When a database is protected, an application that runs in the background on a locked device won&#39;t be able to read or write from it. Instead, it will get &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#error-handling&#34;&gt;DatabaseError&lt;/a&gt; with code &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/rescode.html#ioerr&#34;&gt;&lt;code&gt;SQLITE_IOERR&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How do I create a database in my application?&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This question assumes that your application has to create a new database from scratch. If your app has to open an existing database that is embedded inside your application as a resource, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#how-do-i-open-a-database-stored-as-a-resource-of-my-application&#34;&gt;How do I open a database stored as a resource of my application?&lt;/a&gt; instead.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The database has to be stored in a valid place where it can be created and modified. For example, in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html&#34;&gt;Application Support directory&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let databaseURL = try FileManager.default&#xA;    .url(for: .applicationSupportDirectory, in: .userDomainMask, appropriateFor: nil, create: true)&#xA;    .appendingPathComponent(&#34;db.sqlite&#34;)&#xA;let dbQueue = try DatabaseQueue(path: databaseURL.path)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How do I open a database stored as a resource of my application?&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If your application does not need to modify the database, open a read-only &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-connections&#34;&gt;connection&lt;/a&gt; to your resource:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;var config = Configuration()&#xA;config.readonly = true&#xA;let dbPath = Bundle.main.path(forResource: &#34;db&#34;, ofType: &#34;sqlite&#34;)!&#xA;let dbQueue = try DatabaseQueue(path: dbPath, configuration: config)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If the application should modify the database, you need to copy it to a place where it can be modified. For example, in the &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/library/content/documentation/FileManagement/Conceptual/FileSystemProgrammingGuide/FileSystemOverview/FileSystemOverview.html&#34;&gt;Application Support directory&lt;/a&gt;. Only then, open a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-connections&#34;&gt;connection&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let fileManager = FileManager.default&#xA;let dbPath = try fileManager&#xA;    .url(for: .applicationSupportDirectory, in: .userDomainMask, appropriateFor: nil, create: true)&#xA;    .appendingPathComponent(&#34;db.sqlite&#34;)&#xA;    .path&#xA;if !fileManager.fileExists(atPath: dbPath) {&#xA;    let dbResourcePath = Bundle.main.path(forResource: &#34;db&#34;, ofType: &#34;sqlite&#34;)!&#xA;    try fileManager.copyItem(atPath: dbResourcePath, toPath: dbPath)&#xA;}&#xA;let dbQueue = try DatabaseQueue(path: dbPath)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How do I close a database connection?&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Database connections are automatically closed when they are deinitialized.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When the correct execution of your program depends on precise database closing, use the &lt;code&gt;close()&lt;/code&gt; method:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbQueue.close()&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This explicit &lt;code&gt;close()&lt;/code&gt; may fail with an error. See the inline documentation of this method for more information. Generally speaking, you should not call this method: rely on automatic closing instead.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;FAQ: SQL&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;⬆&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#faq&#34;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#how-do-i-print-a-request-as-sql&#34;&gt;How do I print a request as SQL?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How do I print a request as SQL?&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When you want to debug a request that does not deliver the expected results, you may want to print the SQL that is actually executed.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You can compile the request into a prepared statement:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    let request = Player.filter(Column(&#34;email&#34;) == &#34;arthur@example.com&#34;)&#xA;    let statement = try request.makePreparedRequest(db).statement&#xA;    print(statement) // SELECT * FROM player WHERE email = ?&#xA;    print(statement.arguments) // [&#34;arthur@example.com&#34;]&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Another option is to setup a tracing function that prints out the executed SQL requests. For example, provide a tracing function when you connect to the database:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Prints all SQL statements&#xA;var config = Configuration()&#xA;config.prepareDatabase { db in&#xA;    db.trace { print($0) }&#xA;}&#xA;let dbQueue = try DatabaseQueue(path: dbPath, configuration: config)&#xA;&#xA;try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    // Prints &#34;SELECT * FROM player WHERE email = ?&#34;&#xA;    let players = try Player.filter(Column(&#34;email&#34;) == &#34;arthur@example.com&#34;).fetchAll(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to see statement arguments such as &lt;code&gt;&#39;arthur@example.com&#39;&lt;/code&gt; in the logged statements, &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-configuration&#34;&gt;make statement arguments public&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;blockquote&gt; &#xA; &lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;☝&lt;/span&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Note&lt;/strong&gt;: the generated SQL may change between GRDB releases, without notice: don&#39;t have your application rely on any specific SQL output.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;/blockquote&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;FAQ: General&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;⬆&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#faq&#34;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#how-do-i-monitor-the-duration-of-database-statements-execution&#34;&gt;How do I monitor the duration of database statements execution?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#what-are-experimental-features&#34;&gt;What Are Experimental Features?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#does-grdb-support-library-evolution-and-abi-stability&#34;&gt;Does GRDB support library evolution and ABI stability?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How do I monitor the duration of database statements execution?&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Use the &lt;code&gt;trace(options:_:)&lt;/code&gt; method, with the &lt;code&gt;.profile&lt;/code&gt; option:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;var config = Configuration()&#xA;config.prepareDatabase { db in&#xA;    db.trace(options: .profile) { event in&#xA;        // Prints all SQL statements with their duration&#xA;        print(event)&#xA;        &#xA;        // Access to detailed profiling information&#xA;        if case let .profile(statement, duration) = event, duration &amp;gt; 0.5 {&#xA;            print(&#34;Slow query: \(statement.sql)&#34;)&#xA;        }&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;let dbQueue = try DatabaseQueue(path: dbPath, configuration: config)&#xA;&#xA;try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    let players = try Player.filter(Column(&#34;email&#34;) == &#34;arthur@example.com&#34;).fetchAll(db)&#xA;    // Prints &#34;0.003s SELECT * FROM player WHERE email = ?&#34;&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you want to see statement arguments such as &lt;code&gt;&#39;arthur@example.com&#39;&lt;/code&gt; in the logged statements, &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#database-configuration&#34;&gt;make statement arguments public&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;What Are Experimental Features?&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Since GRDB 1.0, all backwards compatibility guarantees of &lt;a href=&#34;http://semver.org&#34;&gt;semantic versioning&lt;/a&gt; apply: no breaking change will happen until the next major version of the library.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;There is an exception, though: &lt;em&gt;experimental features&lt;/em&gt;, marked with the &#34;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;span&gt;🔥&lt;/span&gt; EXPERIMENTAL&lt;/strong&gt;&#34; badge. Those are advanced features that are too young, or lack user feedback. They are not stabilized yet.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those experimental features are not protected by semantic versioning, and may break between two minor releases of the library.

Indeed, we don&#39;t have any condition to express on any column. Instead, we just need to &#34;require that a book can be joined to its author&#34;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#how-do-i-filter-records-and-only-keep-those-that-are-not-associated-to-another-record&#34;&gt;How do I filter records and only keep those that are NOT associated to another record?&lt;/a&gt; below for the opposite question.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How do I filter records and only keep those that are NOT associated to another record?&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s say you have two record types, &lt;code&gt;Book&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Author&lt;/code&gt;, and you want to only fetch anonymous books that do not have any author.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We start by defining the association between books and authors:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct Book: TableRecord {&#xA;    ...&#xA;    static let author = belongsTo(Author.self)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;struct Author: TableRecord {&#xA;    ...&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then we can write our request and only fetch anonymous books that don&#39;t have any author:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let books: [Book] = try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    // SELECT book.* FROM book&#xA;    // LEFT JOIN author ON author.id = book.authorID&#xA;    // WHERE author.id IS NULL&#xA;    let authorAlias = TableAlias()&#xA;    let request = Book&#xA;        .joining(optional: Book.author.aliased(authorAlias))&#xA;        .filter(!authorAlias.exists)&#xA;    return try request.fetchAll(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This request uses a TableAlias in order to be able to filter on the eventual associated author. We make sure that the &lt;code&gt;Author.primaryKey&lt;/code&gt; is nil, which is another way to say it does not exist: the book has no author.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;See &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#how-do-i-filter-records-and-only-keep-those-that-are-associated-to-another-record&#34;&gt;How do I filter records and only keep those that are associated to another record?&lt;/a&gt; above for the opposite question.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;How do I select only one column of an associated record?&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Let&#39;s say you have two record types, &lt;code&gt;Book&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;Author&lt;/code&gt;, and you want to fetch all books with their author name, but not the full associated author records.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;We start by defining the association between books and authors:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct Book: Decodable, TableRecord {&#xA;    ...&#xA;    static let author = belongsTo(Author.self)&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;struct Author: Decodable, TableRecord {&#xA;    ...&#xA;    enum Columns {&#xA;        static let name = Column(CodingKeys.name)&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;And then we can write our request and the ad-hoc record that decodes it:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;struct BookInfo: Decodable, FetchableRecord {&#xA;    var book: Book&#xA;    var authorName: String? // nil when the book is anonymous&#xA;    &#xA;    static func all() -&amp;gt; QueryInterfaceRequest&amp;lt;BookInfo&amp;gt; {&#xA;        // SELECT book.*, author.name AS authorName&#xA;        // FROM book&#xA;        // LEFT JOIN author ON author.id = book.authorID&#xA;        let authorName = Author.Columns.name.forKey(CodingKeys.authorName)&#xA;        return Book&#xA;            .annotated(withOptional: Book.author.select(authorName))&#xA;            .asRequest(of: BookInfo.self)&#xA;    }&#xA;}&#xA;&#xA;let bookInfos: [BookInfo] = try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    BookInfo.all().fetchAll(db)&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;By defining the request as a static method of BookInfo, you have access to the private &lt;code&gt;CodingKeys.authorName&lt;/code&gt;, and a compiler-checked SQL column name.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;By using the &lt;code&gt;annotated(withOptional:)&lt;/code&gt; method, you append the author name to the top-level selection that can be decoded by the ad-hoc record.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;By using &lt;code&gt;asRequest(of:)&lt;/code&gt;, you enhance the type-safety of your request.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;FAQ: ValueObservation&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;⬆&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#faq&#34;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#why-is-valueobservation-not-publishing-value-changes&#34;&gt;Why is ValueObservation not publishing value changes?&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Why is ValueObservation not publishing value changes?&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it looks that a &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#valueobservation&#34;&gt;ValueObservation&lt;/a&gt; does not notify the changes you expect.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;There may be four possible reasons for this:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ol&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;The expected changes were not committed into the database.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;The expected changes were committed into the database, but were quickly overwritten.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;The observation was stopped.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;The observation does not track the expected database region.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To answer the first two questions, look at SQL statements executed by the database. This is done when you open the database connection:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Prints all SQL statements&#xA;var config = Configuration()&#xA;config.prepareDatabase { db in&#xA;    db.trace { print(&#34;SQL: \($0)&#34;) }&#xA;}&#xA;let dbQueue = try DatabaseQueue(path: dbPath, configuration: config)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If, after that, you are convinced that the expected changes were committed into the database, and not overwritten soon after, trace observation events:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let observation = ValueObservation&#xA;    .tracking { db in ... }&#xA;    .print() // &amp;lt;- trace observation events&#xA;let cancellable = observation.start(...)&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Look at the observation logs which start with &lt;code&gt;cancel&lt;/code&gt; or &lt;code&gt;failure&lt;/code&gt;: maybe the observation was cancelled by your app, or did fail with an error.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Look at the observation logs which start with &lt;code&gt;value&lt;/code&gt;: make sure, again, that the expected value was not actually notified, then overwritten.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Finally, look at the observation logs which start with &lt;code&gt;tracked region&lt;/code&gt;. Does the printed database region cover the expected changes?&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For example:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;empty&lt;/code&gt;: The empty region, which tracks nothing and never triggers the observation.&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;player(*)&lt;/code&gt;: The full &lt;code&gt;player&lt;/code&gt; table&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;player(id,name)&lt;/code&gt;: The &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; columns of the &lt;code&gt;player&lt;/code&gt; table&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;player(id,name)[1]&lt;/code&gt;: The &lt;code&gt;id&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;name&lt;/code&gt; columns of the row with id 1 in the &lt;code&gt;player&lt;/code&gt; table&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;code&gt;player(*),team(*)&lt;/code&gt;: Both the full &lt;code&gt;player&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;team&lt;/code&gt; tables&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If you happen to use the &lt;code&gt;ValueObservation.trackingConstantRegion(_:)&lt;/code&gt; method and see a mismatch between the tracked region and your expectation, then change the definition of your observation by using &lt;code&gt;tracking(_:)&lt;/code&gt;. You should witness that the logs which start with &lt;code&gt;tracked region&lt;/code&gt; now evolve in order to include the expected changes, and that you get the expected notifications.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;If after all those steps (thanks you!), your observation is still failing you, please &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/groue/GRDB.swift/issues/new&#34;&gt;open an issue&lt;/a&gt; and provide a &lt;a href=&#34;https://stackoverflow.com/help/minimal-reproducible-example&#34;&gt;minimal reproducible example&lt;/a&gt;!&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h2&gt;FAQ: Errors&lt;/h2&gt; &#xA;&lt;ul&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;span&gt;⬆&lt;/span&gt; &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#faq&#34;&gt;FAQ&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#generic-parameter-t-could-not-be-inferred&#34;&gt;Generic parameter &#39;T&#39; could not be inferred&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#mutation-of-captured-var-in-concurrently-executing-code&#34;&gt;Mutation of captured var in concurrently-executing code&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#sqlite-error-1-no-such-column&#34;&gt;SQLite error 1 &#34;no such column&#34;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#sqlite-error-10-disk-io-error-sqlite-error-23-not-authorized&#34;&gt;SQLite error 10 &#34;disk I/O error&#34;, SQLite error 23 &#34;not authorized&#34;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA; &lt;li&gt;&lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#sqlite-error-21-wrong-number-of-statement-arguments-with-like-queries&#34;&gt;SQLite error 21 &#34;wrong number of statement arguments&#34; with LIKE queries&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ul&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;Generic parameter &#39;T&#39; could not be inferred&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may get this error when using the &lt;code&gt;read&lt;/code&gt; and &lt;code&gt;write&lt;/code&gt; methods of database queues and pools:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// Generic parameter &#39;T&#39; could not be inferred&#xA;let string = try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    let result = try String.fetchOne(db, ...)&#xA;    return result&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This is a limitation of the Swift compiler.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The general workaround is to explicitly declare the type of the closure result:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;// General Workaround&#xA;let string = try dbQueue.read { db -&amp;gt; String?

Recent versions of SQLite have learned to tell about this deviation from the SQL standard, and this is why you are seeing this error.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;For example: this is not standard SQL: &lt;code&gt;UPDATE player SET name = &#34;Arthur&#34;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The standard version is: &lt;code&gt;UPDATE player SET name = &#39;Arthur&#39;&lt;/code&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It just happens that old versions of SQLite used to accept the former, non-standard version. Newer versions are able to reject it with an error.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;The fix is to change the SQL statements run by the application: replace &lt;code&gt;&#34;&lt;/code&gt; with &lt;code&gt;&#39;&lt;/code&gt; in your string literals.&lt;/p&gt; &lt;p&gt;It may also be time to learn about statement arguments and &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#avoiding-sql-injection&#34;&gt;SQL injection&lt;/a&gt;:&lt;/p&gt; &lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let name: String = ...&#xA;&#xA;// NOT STANDARD (double quote)&#xA;try db.execute(sql: &#34;&#34;&#34;&#xA;    UPDATE player SET name = &#34;\(name)&#34;&#xA;    &#34;&#34;&#34;)&#xA;&#xA;// STANDARD, BUT STILL NOT RECOMMENDED (single quote)&#xA;try db.execute(sql: &#34;UPDATE player SET name = &#39;\(name)&#39;&#34;)&#xA;&#xA;// STANDARD, AND RECOMMENDED (statement arguments)&#xA;try db.execute(sql: &#34;UPDATE player SET name = ?&#34;, arguments: [name])&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &lt;/li&gt; &#xA;&lt;/ol&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;For more information, see &lt;a href=&#34;https://sqlite.org/quirks.html#dblquote&#34;&gt;Double-quoted String Literals Are Accepted&lt;/a&gt;, and &lt;a href=&#34;http://groue.github.io/GRDB.swift/docs/5.24/Structs/Configuration.html#/s:4GRDB13ConfigurationV33acceptsDoubleQuotedStringLiteralsSbvp&#34;&gt;Configuration.acceptsDoubleQuotedStringLiterals&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;SQLite error 10 &#34;disk I/O error&#34;, SQLite error 23 &#34;not authorized&#34;&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;Those errors may be the sign that SQLite can&#39;t access the database due to &lt;a href=&#34;https://raw.githubusercontent.com/groue/GRDB.swift/master/#data-protection&#34;&gt;data protection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;When your application should be able to run in the background on a locked device, it has to catch this error, and, for example, wait for &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiapplicationdelegate/1623044-applicationprotecteddatadidbecom&#34;&gt;UIApplicationDelegate.applicationProtectedDataDidBecomeAvailable(_:)&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/reference/uikit/uiapplicationprotecteddatadidbecomeavailable&#34;&gt;UIApplicationProtectedDataDidBecomeAvailable&lt;/a&gt; notification and retry the failed database operation.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;do {&#xA;    try ...&#xA;} catch DatabaseError.SQLITE_IOERR, DatabaseError.SQLITE_AUTH {&#xA;    // Handle possible data protection error&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;This error can also be prevented altogether by using a more relaxed &lt;a href=&#34;https://developer.apple.com/reference/foundation/filemanager/1653059-file_protection_values&#34;&gt;file protection&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;h3&gt;SQLite error 21 &#34;wrong number of statement arguments&#34; with LIKE queries&lt;/h3&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;You may get the error &#34;wrong number of statement arguments&#34; when executing a LIKE query similar to:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let name = textField.text&#xA;let players = try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    try Player.fetchAll(db, sql: &#34;SELECT * FROM player WHERE name LIKE &#39;%?%&#39;&#34;, arguments: [name])&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;The problem lies in the &lt;code&gt;&#39;%?%&#39;&lt;/code&gt; pattern.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;SQLite only interprets &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; as a parameter when it is a placeholder for a whole value (int, double, string, blob, null). In this incorrect query, &lt;code&gt;?&lt;/code&gt; is just a character in the &lt;code&gt;&#39;%?%&#39;&lt;/code&gt; string: it is not a query parameter, and is not processed in any way. See &lt;a href=&#34;https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html#varparam&#34;&gt;https://www.sqlite.org/lang_expr.html#varparam&lt;/a&gt; for more information about SQLite parameters.&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;p&gt;To fix the error, you can feed the request with the pattern itself, instead of the name:&lt;/p&gt; &#xA;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&#34;language-swift&#34;&gt;let name = textField.text&#xA;let players: [Player] = try dbQueue.read { db in&#xA;    let pattern = &#34;%\(name)%&#34;&#xA;    return try Player.fetchAll(db, sql: &#34;SELECT * FROM player WHERE name LIKE ?&#34;, arguments: [pattern])&#xA;}&#xA;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;
